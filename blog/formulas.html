        Formulas in Combat Design
      </div>
      <div class="top-introduction">
        Whenever a game is involved with a combat system, it is essentially
        asking designers to develop a solid "attack-damage" relationship to make
        the combat process fun and reasonable for players, as well as
        controllable for the designer's end. This article discusses three widely
        used and proven formulas (and their pros and cons) in combat system.
      </div>
      <div class="top-information">
        <span style="color: var(--ro);">time</span> summer 2020 <br />
      </div>
    </div>

    <div id="main">
      <div class="main-title">
        Attributes
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Before jumping into the formula part I think it's necessary to talk
        about the attributes involved in the combat system because they serve as
        the parameters in formulas.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Attack
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Attack is one of the two core attributes in any formulas. A combat
        system cannot run without defining what attack is - from a complex
        attribute influenced by multiple factors such as weapons and character
        strength, to the most refined form where one shot guarantees one kill,
        attack is something that designers must clearly define because it
        practically affects everything in a combat.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Health
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Health serves as the second core attribute. Technically speaking, a
        combat is a continued process for multiple entities until someone's
        health gets reduced below or at zero. Health can come in multiple forms
        - in most games it's a integer while in one-shot-one-kill games it may
        be several lives a character possesses.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Defense
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        This is what makes combat system complicated but fun as well! Defense
        can counteract (at least) part of the impact an attack deals, and this
        is where the magic happens. Finding a well-balanced, intuitive, regular
        formula that explains the relationship between attack and defense is
        what game designers are trying to do - and there seems no perfect
        answer. For the three formulas this article is going to discuss, they
        each has some ideal and bad situations. Picking the right formula for
        the game and continuing making adjustment has to be a hard but fun work
        to do!
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Critical Hit Rate, Dodge Rate, etc.
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Finally, in many modern games there are many rates that come along with
        the character. They are not required, but they do add fun factor for the
        game since players love to see some interesting randomness in the game
        that doesn't break it. The fun thing list can be actually much longer:
        skill effects, cooldown & cooldown reduction, elemental damage... you
        name it.
      </div>

      <div class="main-title">
        Formula One: DMG = ATK - DEF
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        This one has a extended version:<br />
        DMG = (ATK - DEF) * c, where c is a constant value provided by skill or
        equipment.<br />
        Known as the "Subtract Formula", this formula has a long history
        (probably longer than any other formulas) thanks to its intuitive
        demonstration of the relationship between attack and defense.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Pros
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Subtract Formula is arguably the most natural formula designers could
        think of. Given that the change of attack and defense results in linear
        change of damage, and they contribute the same for the damage change, it
        is relatively easy for designers to calculate.<br /><br />
        Plus, Subtract Formula gets sensitive when the attack and the defense
        parameter get closer. Consider a guy with 100 health points and 1
        defense. When the attack increases from 1, the turns it takes to kill
        the guy drastically decreases from 100 to 50, then to 33. This means
        that even the slightest change in this formula may have a whole
        different consequence. In some way players want this feeling of
        "changing a bit changes everything", and tweaking the value becomes a
        very interesting job.<br /><br />
        The relationship where one counters another cannot be simply passed to
        the third player. If A wins B in a turn-based fight, and B wins C, it
        doesn't mean A always wins C. Consider the following three groups of
        figures: <br />
        A: ATK=75, DEF=20, HP=200;<br />
        B: ATK=35, DEF=45, HP=300;<br />
        C: ATK=50, DEF=30, HP=300.<br />
        In this case if A fights C, it takes the same number of turns (6.7) for
        one to kill each. We get the same result if B fights C (60 turns). But
        when we consider A and B, A actually outperforms B from the fact that it
        takes 13.3 attacks for B to kill A but only 10 attacks for A to kill
        B.<br /><br />
        What I am trying to demonstrate is that, thanks to the unpredictable
        chain effect of Subtract Formula, the designers are able to create a
        counter chain like rock paper scissors. This is especially useful in
        some tactical games like Blizzard's StarCraft.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Cons
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        In extreme situation when the defense value is higher than the attack
        value, one gets literally invulnerable. This could ruin the attacking
        side's confidence if happens in a PvP game: "I use my full power to
        attack but even unable to break their defense?? This game is absolutely
        broken." To avoid undesired invulnerability, designers need to carefully
        balance the values.<br /><br />
        Subtract Formula highlights the importance of defense, but probably too
        much. When someone gets attacked by multiple people, the system
        calculates the damage individually, so the same guy's defense gets used
        multiple times in the formula, just like they gets additional defense on
        the house.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Usage
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        From what I know, Subtract Formula and its variations are commonly used
        in earlier RPGs, turn-based tactical games and almost all FPS. Subtract
        Formula is particularly suitable for those which have a relatively
        simple and clear combat system and also want the players understand with
        minimal efforts. In many turn-based strategy games like Fire Emblem
        series, thanks to the limited numeric change, Subtract Formula is both
        player and designer friendly.<br /><br />
        Many FPS games don't emphasize on the defense; instead they tend to
        introduce the damage reduction mechanics. FPS games want players to
        focus on It feels kind of understandable that different parts of human
        bodies absorb different portions of damage, and bullet-proof vests can
        absorb some hit too. In this case the Subtract Formula can be simplified
        to: DMG = ATK * c, where c is a percentage between 0 and 100% or higher
        (headshot). Headshot is a special case where game system reward highly
        skilled (or lucky) players for their effort of aiming at a such small
        area. <br /><br />
        On the other hand, Subtract Formula is also widely applied to
        intentionally stimulate people to focus on the attack and defense. There
        are people willing to pay a lot in return for the chance of being
        invulnerable, which no other formula can offer. Of course, this breaks
        the game and is very controversial over others' experience.
      </div>
      <div class="main-title">
        Formula Two: DMG = ATK * (100% - f(DEF))
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        I want to call this Multiply Formula as the final damage is from attack
        multiplying a value influenced by the defense. Generically, f(DEF) =
        DEF/c+DEF, where c is a constant value defined by game, to make f(DEF)
        always smaller than one. The Multiply Formula also has lots of
        variations, e.g. the ATK can be ATK*2, or there can be other parameter
        in f(DEF), but the sense of this formula is that attack is partly
        blocked but always deals some damage.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Pros
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        The biggest perk for the designers may be that despite the usage of
        multiplying, this formula actually makes calculating the combat ability
        for each side easier. In Multiply Formula ATK is a pure parameter of the
        attacking side while defense and HP are pure defending side parameters.
        When designing ATK we don't need to worry about the defending side, vice
        versa. As for Subtract Formula, since ATK may or may not be larger than
        DEF, designer have to spend more time balancing the both sides.<br /><br />
        Another important advantage for Multiply Formula is that attacks always
        deal damage. There won't be scenarios where someone stacks up defense
        and becomes literally invulnerable.<br /><br />
        Multiply Formula is balanced for both the attacking and defending side.
        It is super clear that the change in ATK brings the same proportional
        change in DMG. Let's consider what this formula tells by changing the
        defense. <br />
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Cons
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Despite the fact that attacks alway deal damage, this could still result
        in disappointment if defense side has healers who can heal even more
        than the damage after getting absorbed. To prevent this, games may set a
        damage absorb threshold, like 75% or some number around that.<br /><br />
        Comparing to Subtract Formula, Multiply Formula gets less sensitive when
        parameters get larger. Unlike Subtract Formula, ATK/DEF/HP is
        independent from each other in Multiply Formula which avoids the players
        putting money for a very high defense - in fact, Multiply Formula makes
        people invest in attack more than defense. I put this in cons because
        this makes the model harder to monetize the attributes.<br /><br />
        The combat could be too long if ATK and DEF increase linearly. This
        could be explained with the concept of diminishing marginal utility: the
        marginal damage actually decreases, so in late game the damage will only
        increase at a very slow rate, and turns it takes to take down the enemy
        gets more and more. Of course there are some ways to cope with that:
        changing the c value in the formula could work; setting a damage absorb
        threshold works too; many games (MOBA especially) uses critical hit to
        increase the effect of attack.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Usage
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">

      </div>
      <div class="main-title">
        Formula Three: DMG = ATK / DEF
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        This formula is called by me Divide Formula for that it puts DEF in
        divisor's place. This formula's got many variations too, for example:<br />
        DMG = ATK^2 / DEF, or: <br />
        DMG = ATK^2 / (ATK + DEF).<br />
        These two variations are also being used and I think it's interesting to
        analyze them too.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Pros
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Just like Multiply Formula, Divide Formula also avoids the situation
        where attacker cannot even break through the defense. ATK is a total
        attacker's parameter and has no relationship with DEF, providing
        designers with space to individually calculate for the two sides, which
        is very important in real work.<br /><br />
        Divide Formula is controllable thanks to its natural adjustment for high
        attack and high defense. Even if someone has a very high ATK or DEF, the
        chance this guy breaks the whole game is rare.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Cons
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Players generally would prefer increasing ATK over DEF because the
        marginal value of ATK increases, while the marginal value of defense
        decreases. <br /><br />
        Like Multiply Formula, Divide Formula lack a point where the change of
        ATK/DEF brings significant change to the DMG. Generally in games with
        Divide Formula, characters have higher attack value than defense, so
        changes in attack result in relatively smooth change in damage. This may
        discourage someone who want to invest a lot in leveling up their
        attributes.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Variations
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Some game uses DMG = ATK^2 / DEF. One of the major problem is that
        players in this game would definitely pursue for higher attack since
        it's mathematically clear that attack is more important in such formula.
        And when ATK>DEF, DMG is actually higher than ATK which seems not so
        intuitive. The attack value feels more like a "reference value".<br /><br />
