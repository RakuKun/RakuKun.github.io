        Creating Quests for MMORPG
      </div>
      <div class="top-introduction">
        I worked during the summer vacation of 2018 as a game design intern for
        Revelation Online Mobile, an MMORPG developed by Pangu Studio of
        NetEase. Under supervision of the lead designer and a system designer
        mentor, I created several side quests focusing on the narrative and
        gameplay that would make players feel immersed in the high fantasy
        world.

      <div class="main-title">Methodology</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Before setting off on the adventure, it is very important to have an
        overview of what the game ‘feels like’ and how we should deliver side
        quests. Revelation's backstory is pretty much like the extension of
        traditional Chinese legend: Classic of Mountains and Seas (Shanhaijing),
        a high fantasy world with many imaginary creatures. This means a large
        scale of possibility to implement new gameplay under a more conservative
        theme. <br />Since the game has already gone through 5 iteration cycle
        by the time I joined, I was able to concentrate on design with a fairly
        complete system framework. But before that, as a quest design working in
        a system design team, I needed to figure out how Relevation's systems
        work.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">system overview</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        System in MMORPG context refers to the framework that takes charge of a
        certain gameplay. Revelation contains a bunch of systems ranging from
        very basic ones such Character Growth, Equipment, quest (just as other
        MMORPGs do) to more specific ones like Adventure, Transformation and
        Camera. The following are those that I mainly worked on.<br />
        I mostly worked in creating content for
        <span class="bold">Adventure System,</span> which provides unique
        experience to amplify the feeling of "freedom" and "depth". It aims to
        encourage players to explore the world by providing engaging
        single-player focused experience. Quests in Adventure System are not
        compulsory and are designed for those who like to spend more time in
        game. <br />
        <span class="bold">Transformation System</span> allows character to
        transform into another creature in the game by replacing their models,
        animations, skills, even the faction. For instance, if a character
        becomes a crab, they walk sideways, use claws to attack, and become
        friends with other AI crabs. The system grants designers brand new ways
        to think about how living things in the game interact with each other,
        and inspires me to implement an unforgettable experience. <br />
        <span class="bold">Camera System</span> is not a rare one in MMO games,
        but the one in Revelation has some cool features such as capturing ghost
        creatures (that are unseen normally) and recognizing the name of
        anything in the frame. <br />
        Player can collect some sound and use a special item to play sounds
        thanks to <span class="bold">Audio System.</span> It is special in a way
        that it records the sound ID thus allowing triggering events that have
        sounds as parameters, which means more options to choose from when
        designing side quests.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">design principle</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        My mentor and I both agree that the most fun comes from the crosspoint
        of multiple system, in other word,
        <span class="bold">combining systems</span>. There are 4 special ones
        listed above, and of course many basic systems (economy, battle, quest,
        achievement) are also open to offer fundamental gameplay. <br />After
        getting familiar with systems, I figured out a pratical way to create
        quests: observe the components of gameplay and try finding some possible
        options for each. The formula is: <br /><span class="important"
          >Interactive Feature * Entity * Fantasy * Reward = Complete
          quest.</span
        ><br />
        Interactive feature comes from the functions that game system could
        offer. Entity is the subject (usually the player) and object of the
        interaction. Fantasy is the narrative logic behind the interaction: why
        is it happening and why the player should take the challenge? And reward
        is of course, what you will get.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/blog/mmorpg/mission-elements.png" />
        </div>
        Players need <span class="bold">feedback and reward</span> for exploring
        Adventure System and doing optional quests. We decided to use a unique
        currency (called "Rainbow Jade") only for buying items in Adventure
        System so it won't affect in-game economic balance and is easier to
        determine the price of items.
      </div>

      <div class="main-title">Production</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        When it comes to production, my major work was filling sets of
        spreadsheets to implement quest logic and adjusting things directly in
        Unity. I created side quests, did rounds of debugging and iteration, and
        helped organize playtests with naive guests.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">ideation</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Before I joined, the team already had some prototype design for
        Adventure System. After playing all of them, I talked with my mentor on
        the feeling of disconnection between the quests and the world. Many
        quests only uses one specific system feature just to show that feature,
        not to serve the world's narrative. This made me feel I am playing a
        collection of mini games, each game was fun but they actually didn't
        help the players know more about the world.
        <br /><span class="bold">direction of improvement</span><br />
        From the former experience and a "all-for-one" faith, I managed to
        figure out what could be the correct direction of fixing the problem and
        creating new side quests. For the old ones, I wanted to find ways to put
        them in a larger context (to fit the backstory, to combine more systems,
        to be more challening and rewarding) so the core fun of Adventure System
        is well reflected in those quests. For the new ones, I stick to the
        design principles concluded in Methodology session.<br />
        <div class="bold">typical workflow</div>
        The majority of "design" work is done with the combination of several
        spreadsheets each of which implements a system in the game. Generally to
        create a quest, I will need to modify quite a few number of
        spreadsheets. Also, as the tool programmers have developed in-engine
        plugins that allows the direct control of in-game entity, I was able to
        place NPC, their patrol routes (if applicable) and modify a small scale
        of terrain.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/blog/mmorpg/systems.png" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">quest examples</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        <span class="bold">Crab Wars</span><br />
        Side quest: Crab Wars asks players to transform into crabs and go
        through a bizarre experience joining in a fight of crabs. This quest
        fully uses the Transform System and is possible with faction switching
        feature.<br />
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/blog/mmorpg/crab-wars.png" />
        </div>
        Quest Procedure: 1. Character (as human) notices some blue crabs
        fighting with red ones. 2. If the character uses transformation tool to
        transform into a crab with either color, they can talk to the crab
        commander and choose to fight for their species. 3. After killing some
        enemy crabs the character can talk to the commander again to finish the
        quest and get reward from crab's gratitude.<br />
        The interesting part in gameplay is that the player could actually do
        quest 2 times for the both team, and have different conversation and
        receive achievement. I think this quest does a good job in encouraging
        players to explore the world, and crabs fighting is an interesting and
        rare point so transforming and getting a quest meets player's curiosity.
        <br /><span class="bold">Unseen Love</span><br />
        Side quest: Unseen Love tells a story between a woman and her ghost
        lover featuring Camera System and branching narratives. <br />
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/blog/mmorpg/unseen-love.png" />
        </div>
        Quest Procedure: 1. Character finds a weeping woman standing under a
        peach tree. 2. As the character talks to the woman, she says that she's
        just missing her husband who set off fishing a month ago and never came
        back. She presumes he's already dead but can't see a fact. The quest is
        not formally given out but the player may search for an answer. 3. If
        the character moves the camera towards the tree, they will find a ghost
        man under the peach tree, looking at the woman. The ghost says that he's
        been dead for some time and even his ghost figure is fading away, and
        his last wish is that the woman may live happy without him. 4. If the
        character takes a photo of the tree and shows to the woman, the woman
        get relieved as she knows now he's always here with her even though she
        cannot see him in the picture.<br />
        I spent some time researching the love story between human and ghost and
        designed this quest using the Camera System that allows the ghost to
        appear in photo frame. I wanted to use dialogue clues as indirect
        control for those who are eager to interact with the world. The most
        surprising moment should be turning on the camera to see a person right
        in front of you, and branching narratives give everyone a chance to
        choose the story they want.

        As the grande finale of my internship, I wrote a design documentation on
        how to implement design features for the team to refer to in the future.
