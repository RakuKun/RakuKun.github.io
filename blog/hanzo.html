      <div class="top-introduction">
        In this article I will try to discuss why I think Hanzo is a
        well-designed hero in Heroes of the Storm...<br />
        ...And more generally, what is a good hero design in MOBA games.

      <div class="main-title">Hanzo in Heroes of the Storm</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        "One shot, one kill."<br /><br />
        I liked playing Hanzo a lot when I was a (really!) active Heroes of the
        Storm (HotS) player who got introduced to the game when playing him in
        Overwatch. Despite that I played Hanzo very badly in Overwatch mostly
        because of my bad FPS aiming skill, miraculously I got used to Hanzo's
        playstyle in HotS relatively quickly, which eventually pushed me to be a
        well-rounded ranged assassin player in HotS. <br /><br />
        And as a game designer I think that Hanzo is a really well-designed hero
        as in HotS. His design fits the word "elegant". In the following
        paragraphs I will be trying to use my personally-adjusted MDA Framework
        to list out the supporting points, as well as more generally, what are
        the major metrics for evaluating a MOBA hero's design from a designer's
        perspective.
      </div>

      <div class="main-title">Mechanics</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        On the mechanic level, a hero's design can be broken down to skills and
        stats, as these are the fundamental attributes of the hero that have a
        direct impact on how players will play them. I will start with Hanzo's
        skillset.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/blog/hanzo/hanzo-1.jpg" />
        </div>
        In Heroes of the Storm, Hanzo is a Ranged Assassin. The Ranged Assassin
        role, once is described in HotS as following:
        <span style="font-style: italic"
          >Ranged Assassin heroes are fragile damage dealers that are able to
          attack their enemies from a safer distance.</span
        >
        And Hanzo specifically, was described in a single sentence as:
        <span style="font-style: italic"
          >"A ranged Assassin who specializes in scouting and taking out enemies
          from a distance."</span
        ><br /><br />
        Hanzo's design perfectly fits both of the descriptions. His Q, W, and
        two ultimates all can deal significant amount of damage from a distance,
        and his Basic Attack (BA) deals second highest damage among HotS's
        heroes' BAs. His E skill provides a temporary zone of vision for the
        team. Long range attacks also mean a great poke ability. <br /><br />
        On the other hand, Hanzo is a fragile hero. his basic HP is low and
        falls in the typical Ranged Assassin's range but he still gets a
        long-cooldown escape skill that can rid him out of danger sometimes. He
        also gets no self-sustain ability and thus relies heavily on healers for
        HP. Having some weakness in a hero is absolutely important because only
        that gives the chance for opponents to find a way to counteract his
        advantages.<br /><br />
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/blog/hanzo/hanzo-2.png" />
        </div>
        The second thing designers can use to evaluate a hero's balance design
        are pick rate and win rate, among casual/low rank/high rank
        (professional) matches. It's dangerous to say a hero's too strong or
        weak while not putting them in a specific environment. Hanzo was a hero
        that's universally picked as the choice for team's damage dealer
        especially in higher ranked matches for his good performance with
        skilled players. His win rate is not that high though, on the other
        hand, as several batches had already made him a pretty balanced hero.
        Hanzo's win rate is lower when we look at it in every match in all
        tiers, which again proves that Hanzo is not an easy hero - to play him
        well you need to practice his skills a lot.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/blog/hanzo/balance-metrics.png" />
        </div>
        On top of stats, "balance" in MOBA games in terms of win rates, as I
        always believe, are only two situations. The first are the so-called
        newbie-friendly heroes. They are easy to learn, easy to master, have
        pretty balanced win rates among different tiers. Pro players may also
        use them in competitive games for their trustworthy consistency. The
        second is easy-to-learn-hard-to-master heroes like Hanzo. They are
        definitely challenging for new players, but have the potential to
        outperform in terms of win rate when used by skillful players. This kind
        of heroes are popular in competitive matches because pro players have
        rich experiences to compensate for the risk.
      </div>

      <div class="main-title">Dynamics</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        The dynamic level in this topic specifically, in my opinion, is how the
        hero's design fit into the game's other systems and therefore
        ultimately, leverage the fun factor. In HotS there are two aspects:
        Terrains and Talents.<br /><br />
        Hanzo's W and Trait skill makes full use of HotS's Terrain system. Most
        heroes cannot see over, or go through terrain so it's a tactically
        important part of the battleground. Hanzo's W skill, Scatter Arrow can
        collide with terrain and structures, splitting into extra arrows. His
        Trait allows him to jump over terrain. Not only these skills is hard to
        use well, but more importantly, they leverage the player's awareness of
        Terrain, which will eventually deepen their understanding of the game's
        systems. A skilled Hanzo player understands terrain's geometry well and
        can use this extra knowing as their advantage against some other heroes
        that have skills that interact with the terrain. It's a virtuous circle.
        What I'd like to address here is that such design doesn't always mean
        developing a new system exclusively for the character; it's about how
        the character "blend in" the game environment.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/blog/hanzo/hanzo-3.jpg" />
        </div>
        Hanzo's Talent choices are incredibly diverse and fun to learn. In
        short, Talents in Heroes of the Storm are unique perks that players
        choose to unlock for their heroes at some certain levels in game.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/blog/hanzo/talents-1.png" />
        </div>
        Hanzo's Talents allow three totally different playstyles. The Q build
        makes Hanzo a true poker and also grants him good waveclear ability. The
        W build is the hardest among three builds, but enables Hanzo to be the
        main carry on the team thanks to its cooldown reduction and consistent
        damage output. The Basic Attack build takes Talents that dramatically
        improve Hanzo's sustained damage. This build has its own risk as Hanzo
        will lose the Talent's bonus attack speed upon dying.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/blog/hanzo/talents-2.png" />
        </div>
        Hanzo's Heroic Abilities (ults), allows players to make Hanzo a pure
        damage machine or have some control ability. These Talents altogether
        makes Hanzo really an interesting hero to play, and to learn. It's
        always a challenging task for a MOBA game to keep player's freshness
        even when they've already played for 2000 hours - while there are many
        heroes in a MOBA game, designing a brand new hero is always a tough task
        for the developers. Therefore, making a hero' learning process rewarding
        and enjoyable is a good solution to work around the problem. Hanzo's
        design ensures that it will take some time to master this hero - perhaps
        hundred of matches, but learning to play him is fun and exciting,
        because again, you're in fact learning to play in three drastically
        different Ranged Assassin playstyles!
      </div>
      <div class="main-title">Aesthetics</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        In the MDA Framework, Aesthetics are the emotional level that directly
        influence the player. Hanzo is originally an Overwatch character before
        he went into Heroes of the Storm, and "Preciseness" is the word that
        best described him. All(!) of his skills in HotS are skillshots
        (abilities that fire a projectile from the source in the chosen
        direction), making Hanzo a very easy-to-learn-hard-to-master hero: a bad
        player might miss every shot except for Basic Attacks, while an
        experienced player can make full use of each skill and inflict damage on
        target heroes. His W skill, Scatter Arrow is a juxtaposition of the
        identically named skill in Overwatch (but was later removed) that uses
        the Terrain as its core mechanism. In short, playing Hanzo in HotS feels
        much like playing him in Overwatch, even though the two games are
        mechanically so different. Elegantly lethal and precise. It's the design
        work that has helped reach such a success.>
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/blog/hanzo/hanzo.jpg" />
        </div>
        In addition to that, Hanzo's gameplay in HotS also involves lots of
        interesting player-player interactions. All of his level 1 Talents are
        quests of which the conditions are to use the skill (or BA) to hit enemy
        heroes a certain times. To me this is far more interesting than "kill
        100 minions to power up the skill" which can be done more mindlessly. To
        do Hanzo's missions the player need to be more aggressive in laning,
        which could result in exposing the hero to a dangerous situation.
        Hanzo's skills like E skill and Dragon's Arrow have big tactical
        usefulness in terms of gaining sight and stunning enemies, thus making a
        perfect team combo possible. <br /><br />
      </div>
      <div class="main-title">Conclusion</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        I think Hanzo in Heroes of the Storm is the best result of transplanting
        a hero from another universe, and is successfully designed in almost
        every aspect. In this article I used the MDA Framework to do the
        analysis, and the following metrics, in my opinion, proves to be useful
        to evaluate the design of a character in MOBA games:<br />
        Mechanics:<br />
        - Does the character's design, working together, fit their described
        role?<br />
        - Are the character's stats/numbers well balanced, not too strong or too
        weak?<br />
        Dynamics: <br />
        - Does the character's abilities come in harmony with the game's other
        systems? <br />
        - Is it fun to learn to play the character?<br />
        - Do players have diverse choices on how they can develop the
        character?<br />
        Aesthetics:<br />
        - Does the design fits the character's backstory and the settings of the
        game?<br />
        - Does the design encourage interesting player-player interaction?
