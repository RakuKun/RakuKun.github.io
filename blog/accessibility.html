        Games should always be an opportunity to experience something beyond
        everyday life for all people. This article discuss some successful
        practices in designing an working accessibility system.

      <div class="main-text">
        This article was written in September 2020, when the world was still
        suffering from the Covid-19 pandemic. When I was staying home working
        and playing video games, it occured to me some day that I needed game
        more than ever to escape the dullness, and I think my situation applies
        to many people in WFH status. On top of that, with the rapid revolution
        in game systems' complexity, graphics, and multiplayer features, the
        need for a working accessibility settings is of much prominence now.
        Making sure that players with different cultural background, different
        physical abilities are all able to enjoy the game is the fundamental
        spirit of equity for a game studio. <br /><br />
        I have been playing Naughty Dog's games and I am glad to find they
        really put some effort into making accessible games. Here's the video
        about
        <span class="important"
          ><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_CD4mB42s"
            >Accessibility in Uncharted 4.</a
          ></span
        >
        What's more, their accessibility system got polished and was almost
        reinvented in The Last of Us 2, making it probably the most accessible
        triple-A game so far. Here's their blog on
        <span class="important"
          ><a

      <div class="main-paragraph-title">Types of Accessibility</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Building accessibility features for games could somehow refer to the
        study in human-computer interaction field since the object of
        interaction is kind of the same: an input hardware (mouse or controller)
        and several output hardware (monitor, speaker and yes, controller).<br /><br />
        There are several basic catagories of accessibility assets:<br />
        - Vision accessibility<br />
        - Hearing accessibility<br />
        - Motion accessibility<br />
        - Culture accessibility<br />
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">Keep the Fun Factor</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        What I want to stress is that building an accessibility system for game
        is more than doing that for a medical device or so. The designers should
        keep in mind that the accessibility should not be at odds with creative
        gameplay. With or without the accessibility feature the game still runs
        for everyone and creates the same illusion where people are put on a
        great journey that's mostly impossible in the real world. Because of the
        importance of keeping the fun factor, people with disabilities should be
        considered as a serious part in the playtesting.<br /><br />
        It's also worth noting that a good accessibility system applies to all
        players, not only those with actual disabilities. Sometimes people want
        to use such function for nothing but simpler experience, sometimes they
        are not so good at certain controls - designers should let people know
        that such assistance is normal and really open to everyone.
      </div>

      <div class="main-title">Vision Accessibility</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Vision accessibility includes color blindness, nearsightedness, and
        other functions for bringing a better vision.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">Color Blindness</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Most games work with colors (though in Ghost of Tsushima you can choose
        to play in black and white) and luckily many of them already have a
        solid system to assist people with color blindness. Some games do better
        in providing different even customizable settings for different types of
        color blindness: protanopia, deuteranopia, tritanopia and more. Here's
        an example from Battlefield V. (The color is actually customizable in
        RGB.)
        <div class="element-image" style="width: 60%">
          <img src="/media/blog/accessibility/color-blindness-1.jpg" />
        </div>
        However, most color blindness assist focuses on only the UI part,
        leaving a huge space for improvement in environmental and character
        design.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">Nearsightedness</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        In fact, Nearsightedness happens more than people would figure, because
        games can make people nearsighted too! It sounds weird but for some
        people whose first language is not English and are playing the game with
        subtitles on like me, sometimes the font size is so small that I have to
        move closer to the monitor in order to read them. I feel like I have
        nearsightedness in those moments. Tweaking the UI still fixes most of
        the problem. But again, for some game where enemies attacks you from
        distance or where you need to stealth through the guards, it can really
        be a nightmare if you cannot see them clearly in the screen. And night
        environment is a natural obstacle for people to observe. There are
        multiple ways to help with the trouble (and some are being used already
        I'm sure):<br />
        - A binocular functions in some game to compensate the sight loss.
        <br />
        - When you are running or hiding, the game camera automatically zooms in
        a bit to help observe the environment.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">Other Tricks</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        One very interesting visual aid I found is using high contrast color to
        actually help players not be distracted by environment.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/blog/accessibility/high-contrast.jpg" />
        </div>
        Playing in such render mode makes me feel I'm hacking the game, not
        actually experience it normally - I fail to enjoy the beauty of the
        graphics, but it does help someone who's having trouble recognizing
        stuff in normal render mode.<br /><br />
        It feels more like a game feature, but in many game levels that run
        completely in night scenes, it's not rare for the system to provide with
        a thermal vision/night vision, like Sam's iconic night vision goggles in
        Splinter Cells series.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/blog/accessibility/night-vision.png" />
        </div>
        These tricks are more like accessibility features because they do
        provide more information for the player - and that's not balanced for
        the ones that don't use them.
      </div>

      <div class="main-title">Hearing Accessibility</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Hearing accessibility is crucial for people in need. In order to
        consider how to assist those players, we can first make a list of the
        possible sounds in the game, and design accessibility features
        accordingly:<br />
        - <span class="bold">Dialogue:</span> subtitle can be useful and
        implementable. The problem is that sometimes it does not offer enough
        information. Another way is to pin a location/item on the map so
        everybody can know without shouting out.<br />
        - <span class="bold">Sound effects,</span> like gunfire or special item.
        These sounds can actually be "shown" in the game if properly displayed
        by a sound indicator, such as bullet trail, or a shooting direction UI.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/blog/accessibility/threat-tracer.jpg" />
        </div>
        Another good way I find is to highlight the figure rims like The Last of
        Us. When used well it doesn't break the game flow.
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/blog/accessibility/listen-mode-1.jpg" />
          <img src="/media/blog/accessibility/listen-mode-2.jpg" />
        </div>
        - <span class="bold">Environmental sound/music.</span> From a
        storytelling perspective it's important to hear the grand composition,
        but from a gameplay standpoint, it plays little role in helping define
        where the enemy is, so normally games don't really visualize it, but
        there are several nice try.<br /><br />
        As you probably find, one principle for designing a hearing
        accessibility feature is try to visualize the sound, as our vision
        system is in fact able to receive more information than we think.
      </div>

      <div class="main-title">Motion Accessibility</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Motion accessibility, in my opinion, is something that should work for
        everyone. Everybody can have motion sickness sometimes. Everybody has
        their preferred input mode and presets that often differ from game to
        game, console to console.<br /><br />
        When we talk about motion sickness, two camera effects are really to
        blame: camera shake and motion blur. Luckily most games allow players to
        switch on/off the function or tweak the strength. The most common motion
        settings available in most games is the option to switch left/right
        joystick, or to switch the left/right click on the mouse.<br /><br />
        In VR games the problem of motion sickness becomes more salient. From
        many experiences building VR games, here's some of the takes I think
        could work:<br />
        - <span class="bold">Slow down!</span> A fun but true fact is that in VR
        world we feel things faster than they actually move. So it's okay if we
        really slow them down a little bit, because your brain is likely to
        magnify the speed anyway. When things move too fast for the brain to
        figure out what's happening, it starts a strike. <br />
        - <span class="bold">Use a vignette mask.</span> Vignette masks get rid
        of some information in the screen's corners, helping players focus on
        the center of the screen. The scientific theory behind this is when
        human eyes receive less information at a time, they are less likely to
        exhaust over time. <br />
        <div class="element-image" style="width: 60%">
          <img src="/media/blog/accessibility/vignette.jpg" />
        </div>
        - <span class="bold">Have something stay in the screen.</span> This
        thing works as a "reference object" in the movement, and since its
        position is fixed in the screen, it creates an illusion that you are not
        moving that fast and things are not changing that quickly.
      </div>

      <div class="main-title">Culture Accessibility</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        It's not common but people from different culture may encounter
        something in the game that causes confusion, for example, bad
        subtitles.<br /><br />
        Developers usually pay attention not to symbolize religion, or custom
        habit in a way that not truthfully reflect the real world. What they
        fail to acknowledge sometimes, is that when talking about a different
        culture, there are much more things that are not common sense: for
        western developers on a game based on Japanese history, not judging and
        designing people from a western moral standpoint is what it takes to
        success. Ghost of Tsushima did a good job creating a loyal, fearless
        ghost warrior from a story standpoint, and it's worth praising that they
        invited Japanese voice actors to record the dialogue. What is missing to
        me is that the mouth animation was still motion captured in English
        dialogue, so when I turned to Japanese voice, it kind of stuck out like
        a sore thumb.
