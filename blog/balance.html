        Aspects of Game Balance
      </div>
      <div class="top-introduction">
        Balancing a game means lots of things. In an intuitive way it's about
        numbers, but that's only the micro side of balancing. The macro side -
        game flow - also should always be at a significant place in the process
        of game making.
      </div>
      <div class="top-information">

    <div id="main">
      <div class="main-title">
        Macro: A Balanced Game Flow
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        The game flow I recently played a little decent game:
        <span class="important"
          ><a href="https://drasnus.itch.io/first-cut">First Cut</a></span
        >
        on itch.io, and I would like to use this game as the analysis object. It
        is not perfectly balanced, which makes the analysis more meaningful and
        targeted.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Setup
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        A balanced setup means the balanced start and goal, and in skill-based
        games, more precisely,
        <span class="bold"
          >the start and goal of each side should be the same.</span
        >
        Both sides spawn with the same ability on symmetrical sides on the
        stage. Their goal is also the same: to one-shot each other. The only
        difference they can make to the characters is the characters' appearance
        but since the change is only decorational and not confusing, it is far
        from breaking the visual balance. So I could say its setup is well
        balanced.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Dynamic
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        A balanced dynamic means that in one round<span class="bold"
          >the passive side still has the chance to strike back</span
        >, and in each separate round
        <span class="bold">players compete under the same condition.</span>
        In this game I call the attacking side the aggressive side and the
        defending side the passive. There is an important rule that helps the
        passive side strike back: If you press attack immediately after blocking
        you will perform a counter attack. This makes counter-attack strategy
        possible and rewarding.<br /><br />
        The game won’t nerf the previous winner or buff the loser, every new
        round starts the same with previous ones. This ensures that if two
        players are on the same skill level, after many rounds their chance of
        winning should be near 50-50. I was playing this game with my classmate
        Aiden and we’ve played for around 300 rounds and our winrate is almost
        equal. We struggled to understand how every line of rule meant in the
        game, and as we proceeded to figure that out, we just found more fun in
        the mechanism.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Choices
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Balanced choices mean that all choices given are equally useful and
        effective. In general, there are several movesets with some slightly
        different attributes. There are three types of attack exactly as the
        rules explained. Since all attacks are one-shot, the difference between
        them is range and speed.<br /><br />
        As Aiden and I tested out, in fact the most effective defending style in
        game is still blocking since it does not require any additional input
        and allows counter-attack right after. We found sidestep less useful
        because it disallows dodging while executing the action, and moved the
        character a short distance which may confuse players because their
        relative positions may flip (after sidestepping A may goes behind B).
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Interaction
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Balanced interaction means the interaction between human and computer is
        fair among hardware. The game allows its multiplayer mode to be played
        by 1 keyboard and 1 gamepad, and that is probably the most unbalanced
        element in this game due to the nature of different hardware. We all
        know that many games have strict constraints with regard to
        cross-platform playing because either mouse-keyboard or gamepad may have
        strong hardware advantage over the others, especially in shooting games
        (CoD, Battlefield, Apex, etc.) and fighting games. In this game, we did
        feel that gamepad and mouse-keyboard differ in the game feel, especially
        when we were trying to direction and dodging.
