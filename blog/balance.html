        Aspects of Game Balance
      </div>
      <div class="top-introduction">
        Balancing a game means lots of things. In an intuitive way it's about
        numbers, but that's only the micro side of balancing. The macro side -
        game flow - also should always be at a significant place in the process
        of game making.
      </div>
      <div class="top-information">

      </div>
    </div>

    <div id="main">
      <div class="main-title">
        Macro: A Balanced Game Flow
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        The game flow I recently played a little decent game:
        <span class="important"
          ><a href="https://drasnus.itch.io/first-cut">First Cut</a></span
        >
        on itch.io, and I would like to use this game as the analysis object. It
        is not perfectly balanced, which makes the analysis more meaningful and
        targeted.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Setup
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        A balanced setup means the balanced start and goal, and in skill-based
        games, more precisely,
        <span class="bold"
          >the start and goal of each side should be the same.</span
        >
        Both sides spawn with the same ability on symmetrical sides on the
        stage. Their goal is also the same: to one-shot each other. The only
        difference they can make to the characters is the characters' appearance
        but since the change is only decorational and not confusing, it is far
        from breaking the visual balance. So I could say its setup is well
        balanced.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Dynamic
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        A balanced dynamic means that in one round<span class="bold"
          >the passive side still has the chance to strike back</span
        >, and in each separate round
        <span class="bold">players compete under the same condition.</span>
        In this game I call the attacking side the aggressive side and the
        defending side the passive. There is an important rule that helps the
        passive side strike back: If you press attack immediately after blocking
        you will perform a counter attack. This makes counter-attack strategy
        possible and rewarding.<br /><br />
        The game won’t nerf the previous winner or buff the loser, every new
        round starts the same with previous ones. This ensures that if two
        players are on the same skill level, after many rounds their chance of
        winning should be near 50-50. I was playing this game with my classmate
        Aiden and we’ve played for around 300 rounds and our winrate is almost
        equal. We struggled to understand how every line of rule meant in the
        game, and as we proceeded to figure that out, we just found more fun in
        the mechanism.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Choices
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Balanced choices mean that all choices given are equally useful and
        effective. In general, there are several movesets with some slightly
        different attributes. There are three types of attack exactly as the
        rules explained. Since all attacks are one-shot, the difference between
        them is range and speed.<br /><br />
        As Aiden and I tested out, in fact the most effective defending style in
        game is still blocking since it does not require any additional input
        and allows counter-attack right after. We found sidestep less useful
        because it disallows dodging while executing the action, and moved the
        character a short distance which may confuse players because their
        relative positions may flip (after sidestepping A may goes behind B).
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Interaction
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Balanced interaction means the interaction between human and computer is
        fair among hardware. The game allows its multiplayer mode to be played
        by 1 keyboard and 1 gamepad, and that is probably the most unbalanced
        element in this game due to the nature of different hardware. We all
        know that many games have strict constraints with regard to
        cross-platform playing because either mouse-keyboard or gamepad may have
        strong hardware advantage over the others, especially in shooting games
        (CoD, Battlefield, Apex, etc.) and fighting games. In this game, we did
        feel that gamepad and mouse-keyboard differ in the game feel, especially
        when we were trying to direction and dodging.

        Micro: A Balanced Model

        To Avoid Blurriness
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        When I introspects the reasons for encountering design hardship and
        failures, for many times I was designing only with intuitive thoughts
        instead of the analysis of the real problem. Intuitive thoughts come
        from the preexisting game experience, and appear like "if I am designing
        this I would use the way XXX uses since that feels great". A symbolic
        example: when people complain a hero in a MOBA is overpowered, they are
        talking their own match experience, while for different ranks a same
        hero may perform much differently.<br /><br />
        Intuitive thoughts feels plausible and are easy to think of, but the
        downside is that they often come blurred and off the track. The
        blurriness comes from our tricky memory that does not always serve 100%
        accurate. For game amateurs that may be sufficient, but dangerous
        especially for game designers who should instead use their professional
        knowledge to analyze and solve the problem. Game designers have rich
        experience in games which may deceive them as a side effect.<br /><br />
        Balancing a game, as a job of game designers', should always stick to
        the common sense of designing: to define a problem, to disintegrate its
        parts, to do research, and to come up with multiple ways from which
        designers choose the most suitable one. It is a highly rational, logical
        process with careful concerns over any possibility of deteriorating the
        situation. That highlights the significance of having a balanced
        mathematical model for a game.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Establishing Models
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        First to clarify: games don't necessarily originates from a math model.
        There are basically two types of game design method: Bottom-up and
        Top-down. While bottom-up approach pieces together of mechanics to give
        rise to a more complex system, top-down approach has a theme/idea formed
        first and breaks it down to gain insight into details. But every game
        will eventually come to a stage where the process of establishing a math
        model should occur.<br /><br />
        Even the simplest games have some rules for which the designers and
        programmers set up a series of variables to handle the input and output.
        For instance, Flappy Bird where all players can do is touching the
        screen within the correct time period. <br /><br />
        To start off, as the game designer, we need to figure out
        <span class="bold"
          >what parameter is ultimately impacting the game experience</span
        >
        (which is usually a dependent variable): <br />
        - <span class="bold">The "grace" time </span> during which the fly input
        is successful.<br />
        And there are the independent variables that we have actually
        control:<br />
        - The bird's flying speed.<br />
        - How fast the bird drops and how far can bird jump upwards.<br />
        - The distance between pillars that allows the bird to fly through.<br />
        - The distance between two stops.<br />
        With these parameters set up, and say we start right between the first
        pair of pillars, we can easily know the time it takes to travel to the
        next challenge:<br />
        - TravelTime = Distance / FlySpeed;<br />
        And if we assume the bird falls at a constant speed, we can know how far
        it falls traveling:<br />
        - FallDistance = FallSpeed * TravelTime;<br />
        As we observe in the game, usually the bird needs to flap wings multiple
        times in between each level in order not to fall, so we also have: -
        FlyDistance = FlapDistance * FlapTimes.<br />
        Now we come to the final answer, <br />
        - GraceDistance = PillarDistance - (FallDistance - FlyDistance)<br />
        -
        <span class="bold"
          >GraceTimePeriod = GraceDistance / FlapDistance;</span
        >
        <br /><br />
        With our key variable being represented by independent variables the
        designers can start tweaking the value and add more variables should
        they like. One thing worth noting is that we start designing under the
        ideal situation to better expose the core design problem and add
        complexity step by step.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">
        Complex Situation
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        In more complex circumstance, designers may spend more time setting up
        an appropriate model. Let's say we have an action game like Furi and we
        need to
        <span class="bold"> balance the boss's hitpoints.</span> Generally the
        first thing is to lay out the component of combat:<br />
        - A hero who can do basic attack and perform skills with separate
        cooldowns. The hero also has some items that could boost up
        themselves.<br />
        - A boss the death of whom signals the victory of combat. The boss also
        has its own skills.<br />
        - A limited combat arena disallowing anybody to flee.<br />
        Then we determine key variables that will definitely influence the game
        experience:<br />
        - Hero's attack damage, skill damage and cooldowns.<br />
        And it's common sense that we don't want the characters to just one-shot
        the boss, so in long-term there will be the so-called DPS cycles that
        makes the boss feel "tanky":<br />
        <span class="bold"
          >Boss HP = (Sum of [((optimal DPS + item DPS) * Suboptimal)]) *
          Cycles.</span
        >
        <br /><br />
        The formula itself is seemingly easier to understand and has even fewer
        variables than the Flappy Bird's. But again we started off with least
        variables as possible, such as optimal DPS as we know in game it's
        impossible to follow the optimal pattern because boss also has skills
        and forces heroes to sacrifice some of DPS for survival. And in an
        action game there are a lot more choices every moment that designers
        should be able to predict. With this in mind, when we are designing
        boss's skills we can always refer to the formula above and see what
        impact it could bring to the existing variables, and that process can be
        very tricky as all variables are dependent on others and changing one
        value could possibly break the experience.
