      <div class="top-introduction">
        Balancing a game means lots of things. In an intuitive way it's about
        numbers, but that's only the micro side of balancing. The macro side -
        game flow - also should always be at a significant place in the process
        of game making.
      </div>
      <div class="top-information">

    </div>

    <div id="main">
      <div class="main-title">Where'd Unbalance Come From?</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Most games, especially multiplayer online games, have to answer twos
        questions: why do players feel unbalanced even if they've already get
        buffed, and how to solve this?<br /><br />
        When I was a undergraduate I would blame numeric unbalance for that: if
        someone's damage is unreasonably high or low, it could potentially break
        the game. But in many games, designers' effort spent tweaking the value
        does not guarantee a "balanced" game back. Genji, a ranged assassin hero
        from Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm, has been nerfed at least 10 times
        since its debut in early 2017, but it's when a patch in late 2018 came
        out that the hero finally stopped being described as "broken". The
        problem is actually in numbers, but in his mechanics.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/blog/balance/genji-1.jpg" />
        </div>
        Genji's E skill, Swift Strike resets its cooldown if an enemy damaged by
        this skill is killed within a short period of time. This special ability
        can easily be triggered when used as last hit, giving Genji extra chance
        to pursue other enemies or get out. His D skill is also a good escape
        skill. What's more, Genji can deal lots of damage when close to the
        enemy, but his AA is ranged and has moderate damage, making him also
        good at poking. This hero is strong both at poking and bursting, and can
        get super annoying when he spoils his extraordinary mobility.<br /><br />
        At the beginning, designers tried to balance Genji by nerfing his
        damage. It didn't work out, Genji was still popular in ranked and
        unranked matches, and new players and professional gamers all like to
        play him. But things changed after a patch in 2020 came out (was too
        late!) which just nerfed his AA range from 5.5 to 4.5. All of a sudden,
        his use rate dropped significantly, and high rank players didn't choose
        to play Genji in ranked matches - he's even not a popularly Banned hero
        anymore.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/blog/balance/genji-2.png" />
        </div>
        I think the patch notes explains itself quite well: Genji must takes
        more risking poking. This patch nerfed one of Genji's three biggest
        advantage, making him more like a real assassin that needs to find a
        good time frame to dive in, kill, and get out. Under some team
        compositions, high level players can still use Genji and deal
        considerable amount of damage, but he's no longer a jack-of-all-traits.
        I think Genji's story explains "balancing" well: a hero cannot have too
        many traits at the same time, because traits here means "privilege" that
        allows prior advantage beyond player's skill level.
      </div>

      <div class="main-title">Macro: A Balanced Game Flow</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        The game flow I recently played a little decent game:
        <span class="link"
          ><a href="https://drasnus.itch.io/first-cut">First Cut</a></span
        >
        on itch.io, and I would like to use this game as the analysis object. It
        is not perfectly balanced, which makes the analysis more meaningful and
        targeted.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">Setup</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        A balanced setup means the balanced start and goal, and in skill-based
        games, more precisely,
        <span class="bold"
          >the start and goal of each side should be the same.</span
        >
        Both sides spawn with the same ability on symmetrical sides on the
        stage. Their goal is also the same: to one-shot each other. The only
        difference they can make to the characters is the characters' appearance
        but since the change is only decorational and not confusing, it is far
        from breaking the visual balance. So I could say its setup is well
        balanced.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">Dynamic</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        A balanced dynamic means that in one round<span class="bold"
          >the passive side still has the chance to strike back</span
        >, and in each separate round
        <span class="bold">players compete under the same condition.</span>
        In this game I call the attacking side the aggressive side and the
        defending side the passive. There is an important rule that helps the
        passive side strike back: If you press attack immediately after blocking
        you will perform a counter attack. This makes counter-attack strategy
        possible and rewarding.<br /><br />
        The game won’t nerf the previous winner or buff the loser, every new
        round starts the same with previous ones. This ensures that if two
        players are on the same skill level, after many rounds their chance of
        winning should be near 50-50. I was playing this game with my classmate
        Aiden and we’ve played for around 300 rounds and our win rate is almost
        equal. We struggled to understand how every line of rule meant in the
        game, and as we proceeded to figure that out, we just found more fun in
        the mechanism.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">Choices</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Balanced choices mean that all choices given are equally useful and
        effective. In general, there are several movesets with some slightly
        different attributes. There are three types of attack exactly as the
        rules explained. Since all attacks are one-shot, the difference between
        them is range and speed.<br /><br />
        As Aiden and I tested out, in fact the most effective defending style in
        game is still blocking since it does not require any additional input
        and allows counter-attack right after. We found sidestep less useful
        because it disallows dodging while executing the action, and moved the
        character a short distance which may confuse players because their
        relative positions may flip (after sidestepping A may goes behind B).
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">Interaction</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Balanced interaction means the interaction between human and computer is
        fair among hardware. The game allows its multiplayer mode to be played
        by 1 keyboard and 1 gamepad, and that is probably the most unbalanced
        element in this game due to the nature of different hardware. We all
        know that many games have strict constraints with regard to
        cross-platform playing because either mouse-keyboard or gamepad may have
        strong hardware advantage over the others, especially in shooting games
        (CoD, Battlefield, Apex, etc.) and fighting games. In this game, we did
        feel that gamepad and mouse-keyboard differ in the game feel, especially
        when we were trying to direction and dodging.

      <div class="main-title">Micro: A Balanced Model</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        From a micro perspective the word "balance" means the mathematical model
        for each player is expected to be equal.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">Avoiding Ambiguity</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        When I introspects the reasons for encountering design hardship and
        failures, for many times I was designing only with intuitive thoughts
        instead of the analysis of the real problem. Intuitive thoughts come
        from the preexisting game experience, and appear like "if I am designing
        this I would use the way XXX uses since that feels great". A symbolic
        example: when people complain a hero in a MOBA is overpowered, they are
        talking their own match experience, while for different ranks a same
        hero may perform much differently.<br /><br />
        Intuitive thoughts feels plausible and are easy to think of, but the
        downside is that they often come blurred and off the track. The
        blurriness comes from our tricky memory that does not always serve 100%
        accurate. For game amateurs that may be sufficient, but dangerous
        especially for game designers who should instead use their professional
        knowledge to analyze and solve the problem. Game designers have rich
        experience in games which may deceive them as a side effect.<br /><br />
        Balancing a game, as a job of game designers', should always stick to
        the common sense of designing: to define a problem, to disintegrate its
        parts, to do research, and to come up with multiple ways from which
        designers choose the most suitable one. It is a highly rational, logical
        process with careful concerns over any possibility of deteriorating the
        situation. That highlights the significance of having a balanced
        mathematical model for a game.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">Establishing Models</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        First to clarify: games don't necessarily originates from a math model.
        There are basically two types of game design method: Bottom-up and
        Top-down. While bottom-up approach pieces together of mechanics to give
        rise to a more complex system, top-down approach has a theme/idea formed
        first and breaks it down to gain insight into details. But every game
        will eventually come to a stage where the process of establishing a math
        model should occur.<br /><br />
        Even the simplest games have some rules for which the designers and
        programmers set up a series of variables to handle the input and output.
        For instance, Flappy Bird where all players can do is touching the
        screen within the correct time period. <br /><br />
        To start off, as the game designer, we need to figure out
        <span class="bold"
          >what parameter is ultimately impacting the game experience</span
        >
        (which is usually a dependent variable): <br />
        - <span class="bold">The "grace" time </span> during which the fly input
        is successful.<br />
        And there are the independent variables that we have actually
        control:<br />
        - The bird's flying speed.<br />
        - How fast the bird drops and how far can bird jump upwards.<br />
        - The distance between pillars that allows the bird to fly through.<br />
        - The distance between two stops.<br />
        With these parameters set up, and say we start right between the first
        pair of pillars, we can easily know the time it takes to travel to the
        next challenge:<br />
        - TravelTime = Distance / FlySpeed;<br />
        And if we assume the bird falls at a constant speed, we can know how far
        it falls traveling:<br />
        - FallDistance = FallSpeed * TravelTime;<br />
        As we observe in the game, usually the bird needs to flap wings multiple
        times in between each level in order not to fall, so we also have: -
        FlyDistance = FlapDistance * FlapTimes.<br />
        Now we come to the final answer, <br />
        - GraceDistance = PillarDistance - (FallDistance - FlyDistance)<br />
        -
        <span class="bold"
          >GraceTimePeriod = GraceDistance / FlapDistance;</span
        >
        <br /><br />
        With our key variable being represented by independent variables the
        designers can start tweaking the value and add more variables should
        they like. One thing worth noting is that we start designing under the
        ideal situation to better expose the core design problem and add
        complexity step by step.
      </div>
      <div class="main-paragraph-title">Complex Situation</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        In more complex circumstance, designers may spend more time setting up
        an appropriate model. Let's say we have an action game like Furi and we
        need to
        <span class="bold"> balance the boss's hitpoints.</span> Generally the
        first thing is to lay out the component of combat:<br />
        - A hero who can do basic attack and perform skills with separate
        cooldowns. The hero also has some items that could boost up
        themselves.<br />
        - A boss the death of whom signals the victory of combat. The boss also
        has its own skills.<br />
        - A limited combat arena disallowing anybody to flee.<br />
        Then we determine key variables that will definitely influence the game
        experience:<br />
        - Hero's attack damage, skill damage and cooldowns.<br />
        And it's common sense that we don't want the characters to just one-shot
        the boss, so in long-term there will be the so-called DPS cycles that
        makes the boss feel "tanky":<br />
        <span class="bold"
          >Boss HP = (Sum of [((optimal DPS + item DPS) * Suboptimal)]) *
          Cycles.</span
        >
        <br /><br />
        The formula itself is seemingly easier to understand and has even fewer
        variables than the Flappy Bird's. But again we started off with least
        variables as possible, such as optimal DPS as we know in game it's
        impossible to follow the optimal pattern because boss also has skills
        and forces heroes to sacrifice some of DPS for survival. And in an
        action game there are a lot more choices every moment that designers
        should be able to predict. With this in mind, when we are designing
        boss's skills we can always refer to the formula above and see what
        impact it could bring to the existing variables, and that process can be
        very tricky as all variables are dependent on others and changing one
        value could possibly break the experience.
