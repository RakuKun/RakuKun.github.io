        What is a Game?
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        &ensp; It is very hard to give a precise definition of game because it
        is changing so fast with everyday new type of games coming out. Stone
        Librande has listed several key elements in his definition: start, goal,
        obstacles and rules, which really makes sense in an objective way.<br />
        For me, game should contain one more element - "fun". Admittedly, having
        fun or not is very subjective since everyone has their own judgement,
        yet to try to get everyone feel interested and happy should always be
        the highest goal in a designer's perspective purely.
      </div>
      <div class="main-title">
        What is a Good Game?
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        &ensp; This question is even harder than the previous one! I think
        "good" is both an objective and subjective word. It is objective so game
        retailers such as Steam have a score system that collects and shows
        players' reviews. It is subjective so we have several measurements by
        which we can roughly evaluate if a game is worth spending money and
        time, and luckily by looking at game elements we can have a way to
        define each measurement.<br />
        &ensp; <span class="bold">Rules.</span> Good games deliver their rules
        in a clear, understandable way, regardless if 8-year or 80-year is
        playing. In addition, good rules should be using the minium rules to
        weave the maximum possibility. Rules not only influence how the game
        runs, but also how players think and make decisions. So providing
        players a bunch of choices is good, and it would be better if the rules
        can make the choices generate themselves.<br />
        &ensp; <span class="bold">Goals.</span> Good games don't always set a
        goal for players. For instance, Minecraft (which I think is a good game)
        don't actually have systematic goals, instead different kinds of players
        have their own things to do: architects build fabulous mansions,
        adventurers travel around the world and kill monsters, community players
        do meaningless things together just to enjoy the group time. On the
        other hand, for those with a goal, the goal, and the player's
        relationship to it, is crystal clear. Dramatic tension increases as the
        player gets closer to the goal.<br />
        &ensp;
        <span class="bold">Narrative & Interaction.</span> Again not all good
        games even have a story, especially true when we look back to the '80s,
        games like Pac-Man told the backstory on the package rather than in-game
        clips. However, good interaction can really make up the missing
        narrative. Players enter the game world and by controlling the game
        characters, they forget about the real world. Nowadays, with the help of
        advancing hardware and software, games are enabled to tell immersive
        stories and drag the players into the created world, and the best would
        be that the interaction pattern fits the narrative.
      </div>
      <div class="main-title">
        What is a Good Story?
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        I like RPG and I won't invest time in an RPG that fails to tell a good
        story since I think story is so crucial as an element to make the game
        logical and meaningful. Games, as other forms of art do, shares the same
        principle for writing a story.<br />
        For me the most important thing of a good story is
        <span class="bold">conflict.</span> It is two opposing forces collider
        with one another. Conflict could make the dramatic moment really strong
        and keep the game at a high level of tension.<br />
        Games have naturally multiple ways to tell stories: visual, sound,
        acting, and even item's description. The possibility is open, the thing
        is to find an efficient and effective way to do the narrative.
