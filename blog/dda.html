      <div class="top-introduction">
        Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment is shaping how people play games in a way
        few have ever imagined: it’s changing how players perceive, evaluate,
        and even judge themselves in the game. However, they face some inherent
        challenges for which, as I argue in this article, higher transparency to
        users and the ability to be optional should be seriously considered.

        Gamers know Electronic Arts (EA) well for its annual releases of EA
        Sports. However, in recent years things have changed. In November 2020,
        a lawsuit was filed against EA for its alleged use of the Dynamic
        Difficulty Adjustment system in three of its EA Sports franchises --
        Madden NFL, FIFA, and NHL that can be traced back to 2017, the year when
        EA publicized a patent exactly called Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment [2].
        The plaintiffs said that EA uses this technology to push players into
        purchasing more loot boxes in the form of Player Packs, saying that it
        effectively makes even high stat players not play as well as they
        should. Despite EA’s consistent denial of its use of DDA to manipulate
        the players actions on spending real dollars to buy in-game boost-up
        packs, it’s admittedly a fact that DDA is in a big reputation maelstrom
        now - and the lack of transparency and choices from player’s end, is at
        least partly to blame.<br /><br />
        But before diving into the moral and efficacy problems, a clarification
        of what is Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment and how it works in a game
        would be helpful.<br /><br />
        Most commonly used in electronic video games, Dynamic Difficulty
        Adjustment (DDA), is an AI-based system that allows the change of
        attributes and behaviors within the game in runtime, adaptively changing
        a game to make it easier or harder. It automatically collects the
        in-game user data and measures the player performance and changes the
        game difficulty to match the player’s skills, while the process of
        adaptation should not be clearly perceived by the players. Its work flow
        can be separated into three parts: The first step needed to implement a
        DDA system is an evaluation of the player’s performance which may
        include determining variables in the game, data collection, setting up
        reference points, and data analysis. Next the system uses models such as
        metrics, probabilistic methods, dynamic scripting to achieve the DDA.
        Finally, the system keeps analyzing the efficacy and adjusting till it
        reaches a “balanced” difficulty curve [3].
      </div>

      <div class="main-title">Part 2: The Curtain of Distrust</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) is not, at least academically, a new
        thing. Back in 2005, a paper by Hunicke has talked about the use of DDA
        and its effectiveness in boosting the player performance while
        maintaining the sense of agency and accomplishment [4]. In recent years,
        although it’s still a myth how many games have used or are using the DDA
        system, the discussion of DDA is getting noticeably more and more heated
        [5]. Despite the fact that Electronic Arts (EA) never officially
        acknowledged its use of DDA, in 2017 there’s a paper from researchers
        from EA detailing the use of a DDA framework targeting at maximizing a
        player’s engagement in a level-based game [6].<br /><br />
        But why do developers make DDA perform undetected in the first place?
        Some argue that players will feel being “cheated” if the difficulty of
        the game is adjusted during or across play sessions, which harms its
        efficacy and ultimately user experience in the game, and it kind of
        became a common practice. But many people just don’t like being
        manipulated by “algorithms” rather than being defeated by a real
        human.<br /><br />
        However, despite the proven effectiveness of such a system in real-world
        applications, there’s a gap between players and games that have to be
        filled: trust. Complaints on EA Sports games have shown that (regardless
        of whether DDA is actually being used) the trust factor can dramatically
        affect how players perceive the game’s system as helpful or evil, and
        eventually impact their user experience. A highly in-theory effective
        system will not perform well if the users don’t trust it - when a ill
        human-AI system is established, users tend to doubt every decision the
        system made for them, and possibly go the opposite way or even ditch the
        system. On the opposite end, the system’s benefits will be realized when
        the technology succeeds to foster appropriate user reliance.<br /><br />
        One of the many ways proven by experiments that automated systems (and
        DDA) can use to obtain user’s trust is to build up the system with
        higher transparency to its users [7]. What is necessary to address here
        is, transparency is not equal to “disclosing everything” which almost
        all for-profit companies will shy away from. Among multiple ways to
        achieve higher transparency, a limited but appropriate disclosure of
        logic-based explanations for the recommendations was found effective
        and, in my opinion, feasible for video games. According to a paper on
        how the disclosure of DDA in the game will affect the player’s
        attributes, the full awareness of DDA proved to be a plus for
        low-performing players in competence but reduced their autonomy, which
        again certifies the fact that to what extent the use of DDA should be
        exposed [8].
      </div>

      <div class="main-title">Part 3: The Nature of Flow</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        As mentioned before, Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment is not a new thing
        but gains popularity in recent years. Its theoretical base can be traced
        back to the Flow theory in the late 90s [9]. Flow, as a psychological
        term, means an “optimal experience, where we feel a sense of
        exhilaration, a deep sense of enjoyment that is long cherished” as
        explained in the original article.
        <div class="element-image" style="width: 50%">
          <img src="/media/blog/dda/flow.png" />
        </div>
        Games are a booming industry: it’s not rare for a game to sell to dozens
        of millions of people, who have, of course, varying levels of skills.
        For developers, a realistic problem is how to handle such a diverse
        player background. This is where the concept of Dynamic Difficulty
        Adjustment came into play, initially. For many years it’s believed that
        the flow experience in video games can be achieved through proper
        implementation of the DDA system, thanks to the system’s ability to
        observe, adapt, and influence player’s in-game performance. <br /><br />
        The point that flow theory didn’t cover is the disconnection between the
        player’s in-game performance and actual competence. Several studies have
        shown that regardless of the player’s skill level, while the unaware use
        of DDA did improve their performance in the game, there’s little
        evidence of an increased competence rating. In other words, a
        low-performing (assisted) player may have an improved score when
        assisted, but they may still come last in the match ranking. Especially
        in online multiplayer video games, such disconnection creates an
        illusion that it’s in fact something in the game not the improvements in
        the player skills that boosted the performance, which again lowers the
        player trust in the game and jeopardizes the overall user experience: no
        one wants to play a game that’s running like a black box. This evidence
        is also supported by another paper on DDA’s impact of making players
        overconfident, while risking player’s motivation because the use of DDA
        was not perceived [10]. <br /><br />

        The second inherent flaw of DDA is the learning process. Every model
        takes time and data to “learn” how the user is doing in the game, and
        the realistic problem of running secretly is that once the process of
        evaluation gets longer than expected or doesn’t produce a good
        adjustment dataset, it’s likely that the player will notice the
        unreasonable difficulty and start to doubt the game’s fairness. Also,
        for players with higher skills, the use of DDA is more likely to make
        the level harder or their opponents stronger, which in some cases
        lower’s the user experience: for everyone there’s a threshold of
        possible skills, if the algorithm fails to realize that, the outcome
        will not be optimal.<br /><br />

        Another solution besides transparency is being optional, in other words,
        exposing some parameters to the users and/or letting players choose if
        they want to turn the system on. I am not alone with this choice. An
        experiment conducted in 2017 showed that while system-oriented DDA and
        player-oriented DDA (which player can directly control the difficulty)
        both improved the overall user experience, player-oriented DDA proved to
        grant the more sense of control than system-oriented DDA [11].
      </div>

      <div class="main-title">Part 4: Devil's Advocate</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        The argument over Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment among players is highly
        controversial. Admittedly, given the heat of researching findings in
        DDA, there may be finer ways (such as Behaviors Trees and Finite-State
        Machines to the Dynamic Scripting approach) that can enhance the user
        experience. The biggest challenge of making the DDA transparent is that
        it reportedly has a negative impact on player’s autonomy in the game.
        Also, the question of if any adaptation of DDA can actually boost the
        user’s competence remains unclear, leaving a negative mood on its
        usability especially in multiplayer games. My response to this, however,
        would be to combine other useful tools to compensate for the negative
        side of DDA, such as user-generated content, or even to use AI teammates
        to boost the sense of autonomy.
        <div class="element-image" style="width: 50%">
          <img src="/media/blog/dda/interface.png" />
        </div>
        What’s more, it’s not only a user experience problem. DDA’s usage and
        detail algorithms vary largely from cases to cases, developers to
        developers, in which in most cases we don’t have exact knowledge on how
        it works in games. And how do we evaluate the user experience in
        different games? Studies have shown that user experience evaluation is
        dependent on multiple variables, how can we decide an algorithm precise
        enough to weigh the player experience in different games [12]? Or is
        that even possible? <br /><br />
        The last challenge is that designing a player-oriented DDA system is a
        daunting task no matter what kind of game it’s designed for. Developing
        such controllable DDA might meet unexpected challenges in terms of
        complexity, and need further research on more categories of game
        applications, where excessive tuning and testing will be required to
        ensure its efficacy. Exposing parameters to users can be out of control,
        especially in multiplayer games where numerous players compete with each
        other. This will require the developers to again, consider the side
        effect of the DDA system before implementing that into the real
        application. While in the future articles may continue to discuss the
        effectiveness of DDA, it might be valuable to switch the focus on the
        real world applications.

      <div class="main-title">Conclusions</div>
      <div class="main-text">
        Before many people realized, Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment has been a
        popular topic among AI systems in games. Now that its use gets more
        controversial, it’s time for the user designers to think twice and try
        making the use more transparent and optional, which I believe will
        benefit the relationship between the game and players, and ultimately
        enhance most user experience. Thank you, now is my turn to play the
        game.
