        What is Game?
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        &ensp; It is very hard to give a precise definition of game because it
        is changing so fast with everyday new type of games coming out. Stone
        Librande has listed several key elements in his definition: start, goal,
        obstacles and rules, which really makes sense in an objective way.<br />
        For me, game should contain one more element - "fun". Admittedly, having
        fun or not is very subjective since everyone has their own judgement,
        yet to try to get everyone feel interested and happy should always be
        the highest goal in a designer's perspective purely.

      <div class="main-title">
        What is a Good Game?
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        &ensp; This question is even harder than the previous one! I think
        "good" is both an objective and subjective word. It is objective so game
        retailers such as Steam have a score system that collects and shows
        players' reviews. It is subjective so we have several measurements by
        which we can roughly evaluate if a game is worth spending money and
        time, and luckily by looking at game elements we can have a way to
        define each measurement.<br />
        &ensp; <span style="font-weight: 600;">Rules.</span> Good games deliver
        their rules in a clear, understandable way, regardless if 8-year or
        80-year is playing. In addition, good rules should be using the minium
        rules to weave the maximum possibility. Rules not only influence how the
        game runs, but also how players think and make decisions. So providing
        players a bunch of choices is good, and it would be better if the rules
        can make the choices generate themselves.<br />
        &ensp; <span style="font-weight: 600;">Goals.</span> Good games don't
        always set a goal for players. For instance, Minecraft (which I think is
        a good game) don't actually have systematic goals, instead different
        kinds of players have their own things to do: architects build fabulous
        mansions, adventurers travel around the world and kill monsters,
        community players do meaningless things together just to enjoy the group
        time. On the other hand, for those with a goal, the goal, and the
        player's relationship to it, is crystal clear. Dramatic tension
        increases as the player gets closer to the goal.<br />
        &ensp;
        <span style="font-weight: 600;">Narrative & Interaction.</span> Again
        not all good games even have a story, especially true when we look back
        to the '80s, games like Pac-Man told the backstory on the package rather
        than in-game clips. However, good interaction can really make up the
        missing narrative. Players enter the game world and by controlling the
        game characters, they forget about the real world. Nowadays, with the
        help of advancing hardware and software, games are enabled to tell
        immersive stories and drag the players into the created world, and the
        best would be that the interaction pattern fits the narrative.

      <div class="main-title">
        What is a Good Story?
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
        I like RPG and I won't invest time in an RPG that fails to tell a good
        story since I think story is so crucial as an element to make the game
        logical and meaningful. Games, as other forms of art do, shares the same
        principle for writing a story.<br />
        For me the most important thing of a good story is
        <span style="font-weight: 600;">conflict.</span> It is two opposing
        forces collider with one another. Conflict could make the dramatic
        moment really strong and keep the game at a high level of tension.<br />
        Games have naturally multiple ways to tell stories: visual, sound,
        acting, and even item's description. The possibility is open, the thing
        is to find an efficient and effective way to do the narrative.
