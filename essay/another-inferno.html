        This small story is part of the course work for History of Western
        Culture in my undergraduate. Though the original version by Dante is
        poem, I rewrote it as an essay for easier understanding.

        Guide: Virgil

      <div class="main-text">
        &ensp;...Among tides of screaming I sensed nearby darkness lurking into
        my head, which forced me to open exhausted eyes. A figure could merely
        be recognized within the shadow, inviting me unconsciously reach my
        hands towards that. Given back immediately was a warm response with
        power - my teacher and guide - Virgil, the great poet. I was able to
        stand up again in his help, starting to focus my eyes observing the
        place. I found myself within a land asleep, waves of sighing coming from
        afar - it was obvious that the wind there was blowing all things dead.
        My teacher gave a short glance of the scene turning around, and said in
        hurry: “Finally thou woke up, yet we should not waste time staying here:
        the Inferno wind withers everything, only the castle before would serve
        as a temporary shelter.” So I stumbled on, trying to catch up with the
        guide’s pace. It was impossible for me to feel the environment in
        detail, however, that should be lonely enough for the faces of all
        passers-by were covered with gloomy umbra. For several times I as if
        found some familiar faces, but soon their figures dimmed down returning
        to the distance.
        <br />
        &ensp; After some rush, we were in the front of a majestic
        <span title="The castle may refer to philosophy."><u>castle</u></span
        >. If an inspired work by the God this castle was, I must lower my head
        to consecrate it with a hymn: here the sourceless wind finally shut its
        mouth, tranquility has taken the place of jittery with elegant light
        fulfilling the atmosphere. We stepped into the castle. Crowded it is,
        the figures that I was unable to recognize all gathered here. My
        extraordinary teacher told me: “This is the place for those who did not
        kneel to the God and who were unable to confess themselves to the God.
        If recognized the person respected or curious, you may not hesitate to
        send your regards.” I answered with an “understood”, walking towards the
        deep of the castle.

        Inside the Castle

      <div class="main-text">
        &ensp; On the way I met many familiar Roman and Chinese emperors. With
        full respect and patience I sent my best greetings to each of them, back
        they sent their regards. Loudness and whispering was everywhere; I
        should not interfere in their emotions so I walked on slowly. Outside
        crowds of great people, suddenly a
        <span
          title="When Mehmed II was alive, the Ottoman Empire was seen hostile by other European countries. The Islam belief was seen hostile by Christianity as well."
          ><u>lonely</u></span
        >
        figure was spotted on one of the castle towers. He stood with his back
        facing me, with a long, golden robe with fur lining and a white hood
        which was a little bit big in size. All of a sudden he turned around,
        making his looking clear which should be no other than Mehmed II. A
        strange feeling had stroke me to climb up the castle tower to get to a
        closer range to him. My teacher understood my thoughts, following my
        steps. <br />
        &ensp; As I got to come face to face with Mehmed II, I was almost
        suppressed by his stateliness: it was as if I am facing a sculpture even
        though I had no difference with him in height. My goodness, was the
        temperament of him so everlasting that it even able to cross the line of
        life and death? Is someone destined to be recorded into the history? I
        was speechless for a while, and both person here and there seemed not to
        speak first. Silence fell between us temporarily. <br />&ensp; It was
        Mehmed II who jingled his eyes and spoke with a smile: “Well, who are
        you, stranger? Why respected Virgil accompanied you on the way? Shocked,
        I told him the origin and progress of this trip, and explained why
        Virgil became the guide in Inferno. After that, Mehmed II nodded his
        head, saying: “So you must be crystal clear about my story. I have been
        here since fallen from the human world, just because I followed the
        <span
          title="Muhammad (570 CE – 8 June 632 CE) was the founder of Islam. According to Islamic doctrine, he is viewed as the final prophet of God in all the main branches of Islam and the sealed messenger."
          ><u>messenger</u></span
        >
        and believed in Allah, not the God or Jesus you said. I desired for
        another Rome, however, I was not recognized by the Roman emperor in the
        end - I was their Islam enemy on the east of Europe continent.” Having
        hearing all this made me surprised and asked: “My respected Sultan, you
        are so eager to win the recognition of the other civilization, but how
        do you consider when this conflicts with your belief?” After hearing my
        question, Mehmed II first stared the dome above as if asking for the
        permission beyond; after getting the revelation, he turned and pondered
        and while then spoke to me with solemnity: “I was the Caliph of Islam
        world when alive. To state my idea to the Christian world, I conquered

          ><u>city of the world’s desire</u></span
        >, making Sancta Sophia into the most magnificent mosque while not
        claiming massive slaughter to the people of that world. I sent some
        Patriarchs to translate Christian documents into Ottoman language. I
        invited

          ><u>Bellini</u></span
        >
        from Venice to create frescos for places in Constantinople and draw my
        portrait. My hands were stained with blood as well as used to write the
        <span
          title="Mehmed II has killed his younger brothers to secure to be emperor. He also has legitimated this to the law, making that the first constitution of the empire."
          ><u>first law for the empire</u></span
        >. I kept Saladin’s demeanor and inherited Caesar’s ambition. However,
        the Ottoman was and is always my whole thing. <br />
        &ensp; After hearing all above, my knowledgeable teacher said: “God!
        Early though I came to this world, I have never forgotten what is
        happening in the human world. For a long time the sky of European world
        was in darkness while Islam world not faraway shone just like
        <span
          title="By Muhammad the crescent moon symbols a new born power – the progress from the crescent moon to the full moon means the Islam overwhelms the darkness and enlightens the world."

        >
        upon the Western land. Not long after that, there came the sun of
        enlightenment, the light here once again went beyond there.” The inferno
        wind came blowing without ending, my thoughts went as if absorbed by the
        vacuum, only blankness lingers around. Knowing that both sides were not
        to talk anymore, my guide with me saluted to the ruler of the Ottoman,
        climbed down the tower and walked outside the castle. I turned my head
        to have the last sight of the castle. It feels like a dream, only the
        history echoed around my head. The light soon dimmed. The darkness once
        again taken over the Inferno ground. <br /><br />
