        Design is different from doing art or photography. It is done by
        figuring out ways to solve real-life problems or enhance user's
        experience. As from a background in Industrial Design, I had rich
        experience in interaction design and prototyping, and they remind me the
        importance of user research, flow experience and interaction design in
        game production progress.

        Gunpla Wars is an interactive experience featuring a retrofitted Gunpla
        model that can be controlled remotely on a phone. This is a group
        project on the course "Introduction to Human Interface Technology" in my
        undergraduate. I took the part as interaction designer and software
        engineer, and my partner Yiming Chen worked as hardware designer.

        Gunpla is a name that contains a large number of robot models in
        Japanese animation series <i>Gundam</i>. I and my partner had a feeling
        for Gunpla models and wanted it to be controlled to move like in its
        animation series. So we bought a Gunpla model and developed hardware and
        software based on it. We basically need to develop a system to send the
        remote control order and to catch and execute it on the Gunpla model.

        <br />
        <span class="element-title">production</span><br />
        My partner focused on wiring the hardware while I used Unity and Arduino
        to do software work. Unity application on mobile phone will get the
        gravity acceleration of the phone and send it via phone's bluetooth.
        Then a bluetooth receiver module on Gunpla model get the signal and
        transfer it to Arduino hardware-based orders. Of course, I spent some
        time building user interface for the application. Coding on Arduino was
        more difficult than I had expected because it evolves some hardware
        adaptation and solid math expression.

        What you are seeing is the version 2.0 of my online portfolio. In this

        more responsive but also keeps the layout simple as possible.

        The color of the website comes from an online palette
