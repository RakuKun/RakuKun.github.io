            &ensp;The Plan is a piece of work from Krillbite Studio. It is so short and special that I can hardly can it a game - it is more like a visual experience with a little interaction. On Steam its review has remained "Overwhelmingly Positive" since the release and most comments mention players' feeling and thoughts after playing. This game absolutely has its magic to attract so many players in only 5 minutes' length.

            &ensp;In The Plan, there is only one key that you need to hold from the start to the end, and that's almost all you can do in the game. You see the character experience something in its journey and may be astonished by the ending. So why not just make it a short animated movie instead of requiring players to do such a easy task? I believe that the secret lies in the experience of uncertainty, the expectation of an unknown outcome.In game, by performing interactions we get closer to the character that we pay attention to. This is a big advantage of game which other media do not have. In The Plan, the camera moves with the movement of the character and the environment changes with it, all indicating we are truly in this circumstance.

            &ensp;Like Mark Twain and Guy de Maupassant often do in their short novels, a surprising end is very effective for adding fun to players' experience. The Plan offers a perfect example of that: yes, surprising but understandable. After a kind of quiet time holding the same key, we hear the beautifully composed background music, and the visual intimates we are drawing near to the end. The game successfully raises our curiosity and tells a joke - we get shocked, amused, inspired but not disappointed at all!
