            Most game player have heard the name of "Bloodborne", many of them have watched its related gameplay or commercial videos, some of them have tried the game, few of them eventually beat the game and fell in love with it. I am the last type.

            &ensp;...Among tides of screaming I sensed nearby darkness lurking into my head, which forced me to open exhausted eyes. A figure could merely be recognized within the shadow, inviting me unconsciously reach my hands towards that. Given back immediately was a warm response with power- my teacher and guide- Virgil, the great poet. I was able to stand up again in his help, starting to focus my eyes observing the place. I found myself within a land asleep, waves of sighing coming from afar- it was obvious that the wind there was blowing all things dead. My teacher gave a short glance of thescene turning around, and said in hurry: “Finally thou woke up, yet we should not waste time staying here: the Inferno wind withers everything, only the castle before would serve as a temporary shelter.” So I stumbled on, trying to catch up with the guide’s pace. It was impossible for me to feel the environment in detail, however, that should be mlonely enough for the faces of all passers-by were covered with gloomy umbra. For several times I as if found some familiar faces, but soon their figures dimmed down returning to the distance.
