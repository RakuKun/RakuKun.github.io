            &ensp;Most game player have heard the name of <i>Bloodborne</i> , many of them have watched its related gameplay or commercial videos, some of them have tried the game, few of them eventually beat the game and fell in love with it. I am the last type. For game designers, Bloodborne has just too many things to learn from: gameplay, storytelling, background setting, even repeatable chalice dungeons. In this article I would like to limit the focus on its gameplay, ie. some basic mechanics.

            &ensp;To be honest, just like other soul games by Fromsoft, the level of Bloodborne is beautiful but seemingly challenging. Being borne in a vast world with few hint for where to go next is hard enough for new players to take the first step. What's even harder, the map of Bloodborne is non-lineal, making those who accidentally step into a harder route fragile to strong enemies and death is almost unavoidable. In this game, however, death is more than a penalty: it is a form of remind presented by the game. The player use his life - usually not very valuable in the early game, to learn some basic rules and routines. Brave players may choose to fight strong monsters, no matter how many deaths it takes, to find the hard route usually leads to a harder place. The game in this way ask "politely" players to think carefully and choose a route they feel comfortable, leaving space to choose for both new players and veterans.

            &ensp;Bloodborne would not be a great example to learn from if it only does the thing above. It uses its map and level design to ease the negative feeling of death by providing shortcuts. After playing the game some time players may find some shortcuts by which they travel through the map much faster. Opening these shortcuts may be a bit challenging, but the reward is worth the effort: Fromsoft's level designers use this way to decompose a large map into smaller regions and make a big goal - usually traveling along the way to defeat the boss - some easier tasks in the world. So if the player opens a shortcut during adventure, even if he/she dies he/she would not feel too depressed because next time the player can travel the map more efficiently. What a nice try in designing such a big world!

            &ensp;If asked what the most significant point of all soul games is, I would definitely say its massive, 3-dimensional map design. Hardly can I find a game with big map that connects each region closely but with proper challenges to discover. What is better, most places you see during the game, can be accessed despite the fact that some places are very dangerous even in the late game. The character actually cannot jump: he/she uses dash jump to move a larger distance. It saves developers' work and works perfectly in the real game by limiting the place the player can reach and leaving platform for exploring if player dashes at a higher place. This design in the experience aspect intrigues player's curiosity and keeps their eyes open. But not every game has that elaborately polished map design - I would rather call it the genius gift - it is not meaningful to analyze the map structure without putting it under the need of art style and storytelling.

            &ensp;It is hard to discuss Bloodborne's combat system without comparing it to Souls series as they share almost identical combat designing. But there is difference which shapes what is called Bloodborne, not "Dark Souls Victoria".

            &ensp;In the game, Gothic buildings, people's clothing and firearms indicate that Bloodborne is based on a Victorian world, a time of technology innovation and city lores. Bloodborne offers a much faster combat pace for both player and enemy. There is only one wooden shield available for blocking, so in most cases it is better to parry and dodge to avoid taking damage. Firearms are most suitable to parry enemy's attack, making them stagger and vulnerable to deadly counter-attacks. To compliment the faster-paced combat and keep the action fast and furious, players can regain some of their lost health if they successfully performs counter-attacks. All the designs in combat system are in wonderful accordance, and highlight the theme of Bloodborne - the lust for blood.
