            &ensp;First released in 2016, <i>Inside </i>is an incredible side-scrolling game that explores further and
            deeper
            in almost
            every
            aspect than developer’s previous critically claimed Limbo. What interests me most, above its marvelous
            graphics and
            intriguing story, is designer’s skill of combining levels and meta- game element for the unique art of
            storytelling.

            &ensp;In so-called “hidden ending” the boy in the game pulls the plug of mind controlling device and felt
            to
            uncontrollable, which is often explained that the character gets out of player’s control as he manages to
            cut the
            relationship inside and outside the game (of course this is only one of the possibilities). This kind of
            gameplay is
            generally referred to “meta-game”, a concept that went heated in recent years. And since this word came to
            people’s
            eyes, it has been a novel, even selling point of a game. The interesting point of meta-game is the feeling
            of breaking
            the routine: the story may not go as you think it should be – something in the game may try to break the
            connection of
            storyline; the same applies to the character, the game objects and scenes. This skill is efficient as it
            solves the
            confliction between player interaction and storytelling. However, when more and more games use similar
            method, the
            meta-games seem to be less appealing as players begin to get familiar with the routine and even predict
            what will
            happen next. This shows the fact that “meta-game” is not beyond game: it is only a method that adds to the
            variety of
            game genres.

            &ensp;What Inside does that excels some others, however, is the story and gameplay bound to it making
            Inside more of a
            “meta-game”. In the game there is no conversation, no narration, no explicit cultural symbols. Even that
            “hidden”
            ending does not tell anything related to the world setting. So how do we players make a “meta-game”
            guessing? Inside
            makes its “hidden” ending surprising but relatively understandable: it is based on the fact that players
            have all gone
            through the “normal” ending and the game puts forward merely an alternative option for the players. The two
            endings are
            not in confliction but explain each other respectively. We consider the “hidden” ending to have meta
            element as it
            seems to indicate the relationship between player and game, and we guess this relationship exists because
            the scenes,
            the game objects support our reasoning. We tend to think the character has cut the connection between him
            and player
            because in the game, many walking-deads are also under the charge of mind controlling devices – the
            reasoning is within
            game context. In a word, the meta element is the reasoning result of our gameplay experience, not the
            condition. The
            “meta” element Inside contains appears to be a rather inner part of its serious topic. The designers add
            difficulties
            for finding the “hidden” ending so we hardly discover the fact that we manipulate the life and death of the
            little boy.
            That is, in my opinion, more successful than using meta element to add fun or novelty to the game.

            &ensp;What is more interesting, though, is the fact that the condition of reaching the hidden ending is so
            challenging
            that few people (at least no one around me!) are able to achieve without googling for a walkthrough.
            Players seek help
            merely for the hidden performance, for some experience they do not have the ability to get on their own.
            Does this
            further expand the definition of a meta-game: to influence the player help complete the game? I do not
            know, because by
            this definition it seems the range meta-game can cover is too broad. Inside is an interesting game because
            it provides
            with various aspect for players to talk about, and “meta” is only one of them which shows the possibility
            the designers
            can use to help tell a better story and form a thicker repressed atmosphere.
