            &ensp;Among tides of screaming I sensed nearby darkness lurking into my head, which forced me to open
            exhausted
            eyes. A
            figure could merely be recognized within the shadow, inviting me unconsciously reach my hands towards that.
            Given back
            immediately was a warm response with power- my teacher and guide- Virgil, the great poet. I was able to
            stand up again
            in his help, starting to focus my eyes observing the place. I found myself within a land asleep, waves of
            sighing
            coming from afar- it was obvious that the wind there was blowing all things dead. My teacher gave a short
            glance of the
            scene turning around, and said in hurry: “Finally thou woke up, yet we should not waste time staying here:
            the Inferno
            wind withers everything, only the castle before would serve as a temporary shelter.” So I stumbled on,
            trying to
            catching up the guide’s pace. It was impossible for me to feel the environment in detail, however, that
            should be
            lonely enough for the faces of all passers-by were covered with gloomy umbra. For several times I as if
            found some
            familiar faces, but soon their figures dimmed down returning to the distance.

        <div class="main-text-en">
            &ensp; After some rush, we were in the front of a majestic castle①. If an inspired work by the God this
            castle
            was, I must
            lower my head to consecrate it with a hymn: here the sourceless wind finally shut its month, tranquility
            has taken the
            place of jittery with elegant light fulfilling the atmosphere. We stepped into the castle. Crowded it is,
            the figures
            that I was unable to recognize all gathered here. My extraordinary teacher told me: “This is the place for
            those who
            did not kneel to the God and who were unable to confess themselves to the God. If recognized the person
            respected or
            curious, you may not hesitate to send your regards.” I answered with a “Understood.”, walking towards the
            deep of the
            castle. On the way I met many familiar Roman and Chinese emperors. With full respect and patience I sent my
            best
            greetings to each of them, back they sent their regards. Loudness and whispering was everywhere; I should
            not interfere
            in their emotions so I walked on slowly. Outside crowds of great people, suddenly a lonely② figure was
            spotted on one
            of the castle towers. He stood with his back facing me, with a long, golden robe with fur lining and a
            white hood which
            was a little bit big in size. All of a sudden he turned around, making his looking clear which should be no
            other than
            Mehmed II③. A strange feeling had stroke me to climb up the castle tower to get to a closer range to him.
            My teacher
            understood my thoughts following my steps.
            <br><br>
        </div>
        <div class="main-text-en">
            &ensp; As I got to become face to face with Mehmed II, I was almost suppressed by his stateliness: it was
            as if I
            am facing a
            sculpture even though I had no difference with him in height. My goodness, was the temperament of him so
            everlasting
            that it even able to cross the line of life and death? Is someone destined to be recorded into the history?
            I was
            speechless for a while, and both person here and there seemed not to speak first. Silence fell between us
            temporarily.
            <br><br>
        </div>
        <div class="main-text-en">
            &ensp; It was Mehmed II who jingled his eyes and spoke with a smile: “Well, who are you, stranger? Why
            respected
            Virgil
            accompanied you on the way? Shocked, I told him the origin and progress of this trip, and explained why
            Virgil became
            the guide in Inferno. After that, Mehmed II nodded his head, saying: “So you must be crystal clear about my
            story. I
            have been here since fallen from the human world, just because I followed the messenger④ and believed in
            Allah, not the
            God or Jesus you said. I desired for another Rome, however, I was not recognized by the Roman emperor in
            the end- I was
            their Islam enemy on the east of Europe continent.” Having hearing all this made me surprised and asked:
            “My respected
            Sultan, you are so eager to win the recognition of the other civilization, but how do you consider when
            this conflicts
            with your belief?” After hearing my question, Mehmed II first stared the dome above as if asking for the
            permission
            beyond; after getting the revelation, he turned and pondered and while then spoke to me with solemnity: “I
            was the
            Caliph of Islam world when alive. To state my idea to the Christian world, I conquered city of the world’s
            desire⑤,
            making Sancta Sophia into the most magnificent mosque while not claiming massive slaughter to the people of
            that world.
            I sent some Patriarchs to translate Christian documents into Ottoman language. I invited Bellini⑥ from
            Venice to create
            frescos for places in Constantinople and draw my portrait. My hands were stained with blood as well as used
            to write
            the first law for the empire⑦. I kept Saladin’s demeanor and inherited Caesar’s ambition⑧. However, the
            Ottoman was and
            is always my whole thing.
            <br><br>
        </div>
        <div class="main-text-en">
            &ensp; After hearing all above, my knowledgeable teacher said: “God! Early though I came to this world, I
            have
            never forgotten
            what is happening in the human world. For a long time the sky of European world was in darkness while Islam
            world not
            faraway shone just like a moon upon the Western land.⑨ Not long after that, there came the sun of
            enlightenment, the
            light here once again went beyond there.”
            The inferno wind came blowing without ending, my thoughts went as if absorbed by the vacuum, only blankness
            lingers
            around. Knowing that both sides were not to talk anymore, my guide with me saluted to the ruler of the
            Ottoman, climbed
            down the tower and walked outside the castle. I turned my head to have the last sight of the castle. It
            feels like a
            dream, only the history echoed around my head. The light soon dimmed. The darkness once again taken over
            the Inferno
            ground.

            &emsp;一片尖啸中，我隐隐感觉到四周的黑暗正在浸入头脑，这迫使我睁开了疲惫的眼睛。从四周的阴影里我勉强能辨认出一个人的模样，便不自觉地向他伸出了手；我立刻获得了温暖有力的回应：那正是我的老师、引路人——诗圣维吉尔。借着他的力量我重新站了起来，定睛观察包围我的地方：这是一片昏睡的大地，远方不停传来叹息的声音——显然狂风击打着其间所有的死灵。我的导师转身看了一眼，随即匆匆地说：“你终于醒来了。但是我们不能在此驻足：地狱的风会让一切生灵枯萎，只有前方的城堡能给我们暂时的庇护。”于是我拖着愚笨的脚步，紧紧跟随在引路人的后面。我来不及细细感受一路上的环境，不过那大概也是寂寞至极的世界；所有过路人的面容被沉沉的阴风包拂，有几次我仿佛看到了熟悉的身影，但他们的轮廓又马上黯淡下去，退回了远方。

        <div class="main-text-cn">
            &emsp;
            一顿奔波后，我们到达了一座雄伟的城堡①前。如果这座城堡亦是上帝一挥手的作品，我也要低下头来高唱赞美的诗歌：在这里没有来源的风终于稍稍闭上了它的嘴巴，宁静代替了烦躁，四周尽是典雅的光芒。我们踱步进了城堡。城堡里人头攒动，不少方前我未能辨认的身影均在此汇聚。我不凡的老师对我说：“这里便是那些世上不甘屈于上帝之下，或是从前来不及表达真意的人停留的地方。你要是在远处认出尊敬、好奇的人，便可走上去向他们问好。”我回答一声“知晓了”便向城堡深处走去。一路上不少我遇到了不少熟悉的中华皇帝、罗马领袖，带着崇敬与耐心一一向他们问好，他们也和善地对我致意。这里充满了高声与私语，我也不便阻扰他们的情绪，只得缓缓前行。在一圈圈的伟大之人外，我忽然在城堡的一处塔楼上看到了一个孤独②的身影。他背对着我站在那里，身上披着的是金色的毛披风，头上着一略大的白色头巾。突然他转过身来，我于是也看清了他的模样，那应该就是奥斯曼的穆罕默德二世③。一种异常的感觉刺激着我爬上塔楼，向他接近，我的老师明白我的意思，也就跟随在了我的后面。

        <div class="main-text-cn">
            &emsp;
            等到和默罕默德二世面对面时，自己好像被他的威严所压倒——虽然我的高度与他相差无几，却感觉自己正在仰视一尊雕塑。我的上帝，伟人的气质竟是如此的恒久，以至于能超越生与死吗？是否有一些人注定要走进人间的史册呢？一时我竟说不出话，而这边和对边的人似乎也无意开口，于是三人暂时陷入了的沉默。
            <br><br>

        <div class="main-text-cn">
            &emsp;
            穆罕默德二世突然眨了眨他的眼睛，笑着说：“哈哈，你是谁，异乡人？尊敬的维吉尔又是怎么和你一行呢？”我受到了震动，赶紧将自己这一行的来源说明了一遍，又解释了维吉尔如何成为自己的指路人。听完之后，穆罕默德二世点头，说道：“想必你很清楚我的故事。我从人间陨落后长留于此，也就是因为我信奉了真主，追随了封印使者④的脚步，而非他们说的上帝与耶稣。我对罗马一心向往，但因为我的信仰永远地无法获得下面那些罗马皇帝的认可，倒是成了他们的伊斯兰教敌人。”听到这话，我心中直呼吃惊，不禁问道：“尊敬的苏丹啊，您心中竟是如此向往获得另一个文明的认可，但当这与您的信仰冲突时，您又是如何考虑的呢？”穆罕默德二世听完我的话，首先看了会上方的穹顶，仿佛在得到何者⑤的允许；得到那边尊者的启示后，他又旋即低下头沉吟了一阵，然后严肃地对我说道：“我曾是伊斯兰世界的哈里发。为了向基督教世界宣告我的理想，我攻占了世界的中心，让那里的圣索菲亚从教堂变成了最宏伟的清真寺；但我又没有随意地向那个世界的人举起屠刀⑥。我让牧首把一些基督教的文献翻译成奥斯曼土耳其语，也从威尼斯请来了贝利尼⑦来为君士坦丁堡的基督教场所制作壁画、给我作像。我的手上沾满了亲人的血液，我也用这只手拿着笔为帝国写下了第一部法律⑧。我保持了萨拉丁的风度，也继承了凯撒的雄心⑨。但是奥斯曼永远是我的全部。”

        </div>
        <div class="main-text-cn">
            &emsp;
            我博学的老师听完他的话后，说：“唉！我虽早早来到这里的世界，却也不曾忘记了人间诸事。那段长长的时间里欧洲的天空一片黑魆，而远处的伊斯兰世界就像一轮弯月，静静地照耀着西方的土地⑩。然而曾几何时，西方的天空又有启蒙的太阳亮起，这边的光芒又远远超过那头。”四周的地狱之风再次送来不止的呼啸，我的思绪又像被虚空吸走，脑海中只余恍惚。见两边都再也说不出什么话来，我的引路者带领着我向奥斯曼的统治者行了礼，走下了塔楼，走出了城堡；我回头看着城堡，只觉刚才经历的都是梦境，只有历史的回音萦绕在心。光线很快地黯淡下去，黑暗重新笼罩了大地。
