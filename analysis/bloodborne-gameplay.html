            &ensp;Most gamers have heard the name of <i>Bloodborne</i> , many of them have watched related gameplay
            or promotion videos, some of them have tried the game, just a few of them eventually beat the game and fell
            in
            love with it. I am the last type, luckily. On the other side, as a game designer, I just find Bloodborne too
            many things to learn from:
            the gameplay, the storytelling, the world structure, even repeatable Chalice Dungeons. Many other games hold
            some very nice parts, too. However, the only difference between being "interesting" and "fabulous" is the
            thin line of inner unity of the design elements: the ability to put everything working well together is more
            important than having a bunch of crazy ideas. Bloodborne does great in this aspect. In
            this article I will be talking mainly about the connection of its mechanics, stories and level design. NO
            SPOILERS (though it is 2019 already) !

            &ensp;Just like the soul series made by From Software, the level of Bloodborne is beautiful and
            challenging as well. Waking up in a vast world with few hints for where to go next already seems hard enough
            for new
            players, let alone there are numbers of monsters along the way. But we do have some good news. The structure
            of Bloodborne's level is quite linear at the beginning and will only grow into branches once
            players get the hang of the game. And whatever players do, they will eventually come to a point where they
            need to face the first progress boss. It is almost unavoidable that many deaths are to come, but that will
            be a very important lesson for players to accept failures and get familiar with the map. It is just fair
            that players use
            life - usually not very valuable in the early game - to learn some basic rules and routines. As the story
            moves on, the game offers more options to choose from and as players have better equipment, higher level
            and more battle experience, it will not be so overwhelming. The game in this way ask "politely" players to
            think
            carefully and choose a
            route they feel comfortable, leaving space to choose for both new players and veterans.

            &ensp;The levels have functions. One crucial thing for Bloodborne's map is the shortcut which drastically
            reduces the time
            needed to
            travel between places and it serves well. First, the designers of Bloodborne use the shortcut to ease the
            negative
            feeling of death. The shortcut is a small goal for players to challenge themselves to prove deaths not in
            vain. if the
            player opens a shortcut during the adventure, even
            if he/she dies he/she would not feel too depressed because next time the player can travel the world more
            efficiently. This design as well in the experience aspect intrigues player's
            curiosity and keeps their eyes open. Secondly, From Software decompose the large world into smaller areas
            and use shortcuts to
            connect them all,
            making them feel larger than they really are. Doors, hidden ladders, stairways just make Bloodborne a real
            3-dimensional
            world connecting the lower world and higher places. Bloodborne makes players "WOW" when they take a long
            journey and
            climb a ladder just to find themselves in front of their wake up location! What is more, developers still
            hold control of the level design as the actions character can do are relatively limited - no jumping, only
            dash jumping when triggered. So designers can make precise prediction about where players are going so the
            work is highly goal-oriented and well controlled.

            &ensp; Not every game has that elaborately polished map design - I would rather call it the genius gift - it
            is
            not meaningful to analyze the map structure without putting it under the need of art style and storytelling.

            &ensp;It is hard to discuss Bloodborne's combat system without comparing it to Souls series as they share
            almost identical combat designing. But there is difference which shapes what is called Bloodborne, not "Dark
            Souls Victoria".

        <div class="main-text en">
            &ensp;In the game, Gothic buildings, people's clothing and firearms indicate that Bloodborne is based on a
            Victorian world, a time of technology innovation and city lores. Bloodborne offers a much faster combat pace
            for both player and enemy. There is only one wooden shield available for blocking, so in most cases it is
            better to parry and dodge to avoid taking damage. Firearms are most suitable to parry enemy's attack, making
            them stagger and vulnerable to deadly counter-attacks. To compliment the faster-paced combat and keep the
            action fast and furious, players can regain some of their lost health if they successfully performs
            counter-attacks. All the designs in combat system are in wonderful accordance, and highlight the theme of
            Bloodborne - the lust for blood. We encounter powerful enemies, get killed by them, kill them back, and
            finally the hunter outfit is stained with much blood.
