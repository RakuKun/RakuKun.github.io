        Plan: An Experiment
      </div>
      <div class="top-introduction">
        The Plan is an experience by Krillbite Studio. It is so short and
        special that I can hardly find a similar one to compare - it is more
        like a visual novel with a little interaction. On Steam its review has
        remained "Overwhelmingly Positive" since the release and most comments
        talk about their feeling and thoughts after playing. This game
        absolutely has some magic to attract so many players in only 5 minutes'
        length.

        Methodology
      </div>
      <div class="main-introduction">
        Before setting off the production, it is very important to have an
        overview of what the game ‘feels like’ and how we deliver side missions.
        It is a high fantasy world with many imaginary creatures and magic.

        system overview
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">adventure system</span><br />
        Adventure System is a collection of gameplay, content and reward. It
        aims to encourage players to explore the game by providing nice single
        player focused experience. Most missions in Adventure System are not
        compulsory, about 5 minutes long, and challenging but also rewarding.
        <br /><span class="element-title">mount system</span><br />
        Mount System is a very special one by which character may transform into
        another species in the game, switching their models, animations, skills,
        even the camp. For instance, if the character becomes a crab, they walk
        sideways, use claws to attack, and become friends with other NPC crabs.
        The system grants designers brand new ways to think about how living
        things in the game interact with each other, and how to implement
        unforgetable experience using it.
        <br /><span class="element-title">photography system</span><br />
        Photography System is not a rare system in MMO games, but the one in
        Revelation has some cool features such as capturing ghost creatures and
        recognising NPC. This opens opportunity to implement it into missions.
        <br /><span class="element-title">audio system</span><br />
        There is a special item to play sounds in the game, and player collects
        sound under the framework of Audio System. It offers interaction with
        the sound, such as affecting some creatures, adding buff, and triggering
        events.

        design principle
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">combine systems</span><br />
        My mentor and I both agree that the most fun comes from the
        cross-product of multiple systems. There are 4 special ones listed
        above, and of course many basic systems (economy, battle, mission,
        achievement) are so fundamental that we cannot go without them.
        <br />One of the practical ways is to think of the components of
        gameplay and try finding some possible options for each. The formula is:
        <br /><span class="important"
          >Interaction Function * Entity * (Other) = Complete Gameplay</span
        >
        <br /><span class="element-title">reward</span><br />
        It is better to reward players for exploring Adventure System as the
        missions are additional and optional. We decided to use a unique
        currency (called "Rainbow Jade") for missions so it won't affect in-game
        economic balance and is easier to determine the price of items.

        It will be a 4min experience including interaction time so do not make
        the story too complicated. We go for a classroom romance since everyone
        probably has some experience on that. And we think adding a little
        surprise in story would help with the emotional flow. <br /><span

        We learn from What Remains of Edith Finch combining interactions with

        interaction so they feel being in the situation rather than watching a
        story sequence.
