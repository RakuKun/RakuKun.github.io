        Creating Missions for MMORPG
      </div>
      <div class="top-introduction">
        I worked during the summer vacation of 2018 as a game design intern for
        Revelation Online Mobile, an MMORPG developed by Pangu Studio of
        NetEase. Under supervision of the lead designer and a system designer
        mentor, I created several side quests focusing on the narrative and
        gameplay that would make players feel immersed in the high fantasy
        world.

        Methodology
      </div>
      <div class="main-description">
        Before setting off on the adventure, it is very important to have an
        overview of what the game ‘feels like’ and how we should deliver side
        missions. Revelation's backstory is pretty much like the extension of
        traditional Chinese legend: Classic of Mountains and Seas (Shanhaijing),
        a high fantasy world with many imaginary creatures. This means a large
        scale of possibility to implement new gameplay under a more conservative
        theme. <br />Since the game has already gone through 5 iteration cycle
        by the time I joined, I was able to concentrate on design with a fairly
        complete system framework.
      </div>

        system overview
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        System in MMORPG context refers to the framework that takes charge of a
        certain gameplay. Revelation contains a bunch of systems ranging from
        very basic ones such Character Growth, Equipment, Mission (just as other
        MMORPGs do) to more specific ones like Adventure, Transformation and
        Camera. The following are those that I mainly worked on.<br />
        <span class="element-title">Adventure System</span><br />
        I mostly worked in creating content for Adventure System, which provides
        unique experience to amplify the feeling of "freedom" and "depth". It
        aims to encourage players to explore the world by providing engaging
        single-player focused experience. Missions in Adventure System are not
        compulsory and are designed for those who like to spend more time in
        game.
        <br /><span class="element-title">Transformation System</span><br />
        Transformation System allows character to transform into another
        creature in the game by replacing their models, animations, skills, even
        the faction. For instance, if a character becomes a crab, they walk
        sideways, use claws to attack, and become friends with other AI crabs.
        The system grants designers brand new ways to think about how living
        things in the game interact with each other, and inspires me to
        implement an unforgettable experience.
        <br /><span class="element-title">Camera System</span><br />
        Camera System is not a rare one in MMO games, but the one in Revelation
        has some cool features such as capturing ghost creatures (that are
        unseen normally) and recognizing the name of anything in the frame.
        <br /><span class="element-title">Audio System</span><br />
        Player can collect some sound and use a special item to play sounds
        thanks to Audio System. It is special in a way that it records the sound
        ID thus allowing triggering events that have sounds as parameters, which
        means more options to choose from when designing side quests.

        design principle
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">combining systems</span><br />
        My mentor and I both agree that the most fun comes from the crosspoint
        of multiple systems. There are 4 special ones listed above, and of
        course many basic systems (economy, battle, mission, achievement) are
        also open to offer fundamental gameplay.
        <br />After getting familiar with systems, I figured out a pratical way
        to create quests: observe the components of gameplay and try finding
        some possible options for each. The formula is: <br /><span
          class="important"
          >Interactive Feature * Entity * Fantasy * Reward = Complete
          Mission.</span
        ><br />
        Interactive feature comes from the functions that game system could
        offer. Entity is the subject (usually the player) and object of the
        interaction. Fantasy is the narrative logic behind the interaction: why
        is it happening and why the player should take the challenge? And reward
        is of course, what you will get.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/analysis/mmorpg/mission-elements.png" />
        </div>
        <br /><span class="element-title">reward</span><br />
        Players need feedback and reward for exploring Adventure System and
        doing optional quests. We decided to use a unique currency (called
        "Rainbow Jade") only for buying items in Adventure System so it won't
        affect in-game economic balance and is easier to determine the price of
        items.

        Production
      </div>
      <div class="main-description">
        When it comes to production, my major work was filling Excel sheets and
        adjusting things directly in Unity. I created side quests, did rounds of
        debugging and iteration, and helped organize playtests with naive
        guests.

        <span class="element-title">problems of former ones</span><br />
        Before I joined, the team already had some prototype design for
        Adventure System. After playing all of them, I did sense the
        disconnection between the quests and the world. Here is my analysis.
        <br /><span class="element-title">improvement direction</span><br />
        I managed to figure out what is the right track of fixing the problem
        and creating new side missions. For the old ones, I try to find ways to
        put them in a larger context (to fit the backstory, to combine more
        systems, to be more challening and rewarding) so the core fun of
        Adventure System is well reflected in those missions. For the new ones,
        I stick to the design principles concluded in Methodology session.

        mission examples
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">Crab Wars</span><br />
        Side mission: Crab Wars lets players transform into a crab and go
        through a bizarre experience in fighting with and against crabs. This
        mission fully uses the Transform System and uses trick in switching
        factions.<br />
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/analysis/mmorpg/crab-wars.png" />
        </div>
        Mission Procedure: 1. Character (as human) notices some blue crabs
        fighting with red ones. 2. If the character uses transformation tool to
        transform into a crab with either color, they can talk to the crab
        commander and choose to fight for their species. 3. After killing some
        enemy crabs the character can talk to the commander again to finish the
        mission and get reward from crab's gratitude.<br />
        The interesting part in gameplay is that the player could actually do
        mission 2 times for the both team, and have different conversation and
        receive achievement. I think this mission does a good job in encouraging
        players to explore the world, and crabs fighting is an interesting and
        rare point so transforming and getting a mission meets player's
        curiosity.
        <br /><span class="element-title">Unseen Love</span><br />
        Side mission: Unseen Love tells a story between a woman and her ghost
        lover using the feature of Camera System. <br />
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/analysis/mmorpg/unseen-love.png" />
        </div>
        Mission Procedure: 1. Character wanders on the street and finds a
        weeping woman under a peach tree. 2. As the character talks to the
        woman, she tells that she's missing her dead husband. She has a feeling
        that her husband is still around there. 3. If the character uses camera,
        they will find a ghost man under the peach tree, looking at the woman.
        The ghost says that he's been dead for some time and even his ghost
        figure is fading away, and he wants the woman to live happy without her.
        4. If the character takes a photo of the man and shows to the woman, the
        woman get relieved as she knows now he's always here with her.<br />
        I spent some time researching the love story between human and ghost and
        designed this mission using the Camera System that allows the ghost to
        appear in frame. I want to use dialogue clues as indirect control for
        those who are eager to solve problems. The most surprising moment should
        be turning on the camera to see a person right in front of you!
