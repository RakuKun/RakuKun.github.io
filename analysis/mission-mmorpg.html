        Creating Missions for MMORPG
      </div>
      <div class="top-introduction">
        I worked during the summer vacation of 2018 as a game design intern for
        Revelation Online Mobile, an MMORPG developed by Pangu Studio of
        NetEase. Under the supervision of lead designer and a system designer
        fellow, I created several side missions with a focus on fun features
        that would make players feel really immersed in the world. The ideal
        side missions don’t have to be very long yet the innovation of gameplay
        and storytelling is highly valued.

        Methodology
      </div>
      <div class="main-introduction">
        Before setting off the production, it is very important to have an
        overview of what the game ‘feels like’ and how we deliver side missions.
        It is a high fantasy world with many imaginary creatures and magic.

        system overview
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">adventure system</span><br />
        Adventure System is a collection of gameplay, content and reward. It
        aims to encourage players to explore the game by providing nice single
        player focused experience. Most missions in Adventure System are not
        compulsory, about 5 minutes long, and challenging but also rewarding.
        <br /><span class="element-title">transformation system</span><br />
        Transformation System is a very special one by which character may
        transform into another species in the game, replacing the models,
        animations, skills, even the camp with the new one. For instance, if a
        character becomes a crab, they walk sideways, use claws to attack, and
        become friends with other NPC crabs. The system grants designers brand
        new ways to think about how living things in the game interact with each
        other, and how to implement unforgettable experience using it.
        <br /><span class="element-title">camera system</span><br />
        Photography System is not a rare system in MMO games, but the one in
        Revelation has some cool features such as capturing ghost creatures and
        recognizing NPC. This opens opportunity to implement it into missions.
        <br /><span class="element-title">audio system</span><br />
        There is a special item to play sounds in the game, and player collects
        sound under the framework of Audio System. It offers interaction with
        the sound, such as affecting some creatures, adding buff, and triggering
        events.

        design principle
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">combine systems</span><br />
        My mentor and I both agree that the most fun comes from the
        cross-product of multiple systems. There are 4 special ones listed
        above, and of course many basic systems (economy, battle, mission,
        achievement) are so fundamental that we cannot go without them.
        <br />One of the practical ways is to think of the components of
        gameplay and try finding some possible options for each. The formula is:
        <br /><span class="important"
          >Interaction Function * Entity * (Other) = Complete Gameplay</span
        >
        <br /><span class="element-title">reward</span><br />
        It is better to reward players for exploring Adventure System as the
        missions are additional and optional. We decided to use a unique
        currency (called "Rainbow Jade") for missions so it won't affect in-game
        economic balance and is easier to determine the price of items.

        Production
      </div>
      <div class="main-introduction">
        During the internship I analysed existing gameplay and created many new
        ones.

        <span class="element-title">problems of former ones</span><br />
        Before I joined, the team already had some prototype design for
        Adventure System. After playing all of them, I did sense the
        disconnection between the quests and the world. Here is my analysis.
        <br /><span class="element-title">improvement direction</span><br />
        I managed to figure out what is the right track of fixing the problem
        and creating new side missions. For the old ones, I try to find ways to
        put them in a larger context (to fit the backstory, to combine more
        systems, to be more challening and rewarding) so the core fun of
        Adventure System is well reflected in those missions. For the new ones,
        I stick to the design principles concluded in Methodology session.

      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">Crab Wars</span><br />
        Side mission: Crab Wars lets players transform into a crab and go
        through a bizarre experience in fighting with and against crabs. This
        mission fully uses the Transform System and uses trick in switching
        camps.<br />
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/analysis/mmorpg/crab-wars.png" />
        </div>
        Mission Procedure: 1. Character (as human) notices some blue crabs
        fighting with red ones. 2. If the character uses transformation tool to
        transform into a crab with either color, they can talk to the crab
        commander and choose to fight for their species. 3. After killing some
        enemy crabs the character can talk to the commander again to finish the
        mission and get reward from crab's gratitude.<br />
        The interesting part in gameplay is that the player could actually do
        mission 2 times for the both team, and have different conversation and
        receive achievement. I think this mission does a good job in encouraging
        players to explore the world, and crabs fighting is an interesting and
        rare point so transforming and getting a mission meets player's
        curiosity.
        <br /><span class="element-title">Unseen Love</span><br />
        Side mission: Unseen Love tells a story between a woman and her ghost
        lover using the feature of Camera System. <br />
        Mission Procedure: 1. Character wanders on the street and finds a
        weeping woman under a peach tree. 2. As the character talks to the
        woman, she tells that she's missing her dead husband. She has a feeling
        that her husband is still around there. 3. If the character uses camera,
        they will find a ghost man under the peach tree, looking at the woman.
        The ghost says that he's been dead for some time and even his ghost
        figure is fading away, and he wants the woman to live happy without her.
        4. If the character takes a photo of the man and shows to the woman, the
        woman get relieved as she knows now he's always here with her.<br />
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/analysis/mmorpg/unseen-love.png" />
        </div>
        I spent some time researching the love story between human and ghost and
        designed this mission using the Camera System that allows the ghost to
        appear in frame. I want to use dialogue clues as indirect control for
        those who are eager to solve problems. The most surprising moment should
        be turning on the camera to see a person right in front of you!
