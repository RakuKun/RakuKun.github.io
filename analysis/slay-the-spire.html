        Slay the Spire: Engagement and Balance (ongoing)

      <div class="top-introduction">
        Slay the Spire is a roguelike video game developed by American studio
        MegaCrit. The game was officially released in January 2019. This article
        will focus on the game's way to keep players engaged and how the game is
        balanced.

      <div class="main-description">
        Slay the Spire is a roguelike, deck-building game. Just by the genre it
        is far from being so engaging and fun to play, absolutely there is some
        magic in game design that makes the common things uncommon.

      <div class="main-design-description">
        Though today the definition of roguelike is quickly changing as new
        roguelikes arise and old ones uncategorized, the long-time popular game
        genre has some elements unchanged.
        <span class="element-title">procedurally generated levels</span><br />
        Slay the Spire uses randomly generated level to dramatically increase
        replayability since every one is unique. <br />
        But is it really "random"? The answer is "NO". I would rather name it's
        semi-randomly creating levels. The choice is right since making levels
        should be designer's work, not computer's. So far as I have noticed, the
        game tries to keep a balance in different routes so you won't meet
        elites in a row and you can hardly find two campfires with nothing in
        between. And there are three certain things in the level:<br />
        The beginning of each stage is always a counter against normal
        enemies.<br />
        On about half way through each stage you will always run into a chest
        room.<br />
        Before fighting the boss of each stage (which is random) you have a
        chance of visiting a campfire.<br />
        The first one just sounds reasonable. The last two things really help
        decrease the chaos and let players take a precious rest when they really
        feel need to.

        </div>
        <span class="element-title">permadeath</span><br />
        I don't think permadeath is should be a must in roguelike games, in the
        modern context. The concept Roguelike started late '80s where games were
        considered a male sport and procedurally generated maps and permadeath
        were invented as effective ways to deal with the limitation in memory
        capability.<br />
        Slay the Spire also has permadeath, however, on the other hand, it does
        offer ways (seemingly consciously) for players to cope with failure in
        the game, by saving and loading. By replaying the combat the player got
        a chance to make up their mistakes and calculate their cards again. It
        is even not a glitch since the feature is too obviously to be considered
        as a program bug.

        </div>
        <span class="element-title">turn-based</span><br />
        Turn-based gameplay is another optional feature of roguelikes. The good
        thing for any turn-based games is that at least it is friendly for all
        players regardless of their "reflection speed" or "fighting instinct",
        so it is potentially designed for all ages.
