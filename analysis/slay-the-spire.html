        Slay the Spire is a roguelike video game developed by American studio
        MegaCrit, officially released in January 2019. This article will try
        analyzing game's approach to keep a high engagement whilst balanced at
        the same time.

      <div class="main-description">
        Slay the Spire is a roguelike, deck-building game. According to
        <a
          class="important"
          target="_blank"
          href="https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JoshBycer/20200306/359140/The_Importance_of_a_Well_Defined_Core_Gameplay_Loop.php"
          >an article on Gamasutra,</a
        >
        roguelike games benefit from "compartmentalizing their core gameplay
        loop while still providing long-term value" so many of them stands out
        in today's video game environment where "customers don't have the time
        to find the fun of a title". Slay the Spire has a great pick-up-and-play
        feel, given that players know they will either win or lose usually in
        less an hour.<br />
        So the question is, what exactly makes each run feel so engaging?
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-title">
        <hr />
        roguelike
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        Though today the definition of roguelike is quickly changing as new
        roguelikes arise and old ones uncategorized, the long-time popular game
        genre has some elements unchanged.<br />
        <span class="element-title">procedurally generated levels</span><br />
        Slay the Spire uses randomly generated level to dramatically increase
        its replayability. In a relatively simple way, each run is slightly
        different from any previous one, and players meet different enemies and
        bosses, get different cards and relics, which eventually makes players'
        combat choice and overall strategy. Randomness is a great help when
        designers want to build an entertainment that can then be repeated with
        variance and new challenges again and again. <br /><br />
        The magic of having randomness is that it fits the essence of "game" and
        the nature of human desire for an unknown adventure. Games are an
        entertainment both challenging and rewarding. In Slay the spire players
        face different challenging situation as they start a run and go deeper,
        but the game keeps rewarding them with more powerful cards and relics,
        which forms an ideal engagement curve.<br />
        <span class="element-title">permadeath</span><br />
        I don't think permadeath should be a must in roguelike games, especially
        in the modern context. The concept Roguelike started late '80s where
        games were considered an exclusive sport for male and that procedurally
        generated maps and permadeath were invented as effective ways to deal
        with the limitation in computer's memory capability. Today, almost every
        home PC can run a card game like Slay the Spire, but the game still uses
        permadeath to remind players of the importance of their choices so as to
        put some nervosity on each move. And when the players start to think of
        their actions seriously, they are been already dragged into the world
        and keep the high commitment.<br /><br />
        The game, however, on the other hand, has left ways (seemingly on
        purpose) for players to cope with permadeath in the game, by saving and
        loading. By replaying the combat the player got a chance to make up
        their mistakes and calculate their cards again. It is a glitch that
        everyone uses to save time and play better.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/analysis/slay-the-spire/death.png" />
        </div>
        <span class="element-title">turn-based</span><br />
        Turn-based gameplay is another optional feature of roguelikes. The good
        thing for any turn-based games is that at least it is friendly for all
        players regardless of their "reflection speed" or "fighting instinct",
        so it is potentially designed for all ages.
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-title">
        <hr />
        deck-building
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        Deck building is another thing that makes Slay the Spire engaging and
        addicting. The ultimate reason for this, in my opinion, is the same
        motivation for playing an RPG - the feeling of growth. Starting with
        basic cards to eventually beating the final boss, it is deck that makes
        up the majority of visible growth in the game.
        <br /><span class="element-title">playing with randomness</span><br />
        Players have the chance to choose from three random cards of your color
        after every battle. Again, all three random cards may be just useless,
        but players can choose skip the cards. The designers want players on
        different level all feel good about their choices, so giving optional
        choices is still important. People all like to see what the system
        offers - it always feels great to gamble without concerning losing
        money, right?
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/analysis/slay-the-spire/choose-a-card.jpg" />
        </div>
        And it even feels better when system drops upgraded cards, which gives a
        feeling that "whatever I pick I hit pay dirt".
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/analysis/slay-the-spire/event.jpg" />
        </div>
        The same design philosophy applies to the events, too. Events happening
        in ? rooms share the high risk - high reward trait, and the ability to
        accept the offer or not is granted to the players: new players may skip
        the risk (and reward) while experienced players could play in a more
        exciting pace. Gambling is mankind's nature - Slay the Spire manipulates
        that.
        <br /><span class="element-title">the changing strategy</span><br />
        Slay the Spire, like many other games, has short goals and long-term
        goals. Finding a best strategy to beat the next enemy fight is the short
        goal, and beating a run is the long goal. This brings the discussion
        about the altering strategy. In early phases picking up a card is very
        worth considering since they are almost all better than basic cards, but
        in late phases having a new card is no longer that tempting once their
        deck is stable enough where one new card could break the synergy and the
        potential of bad draws.<br /><br />
        The dynamic is in fact happening in every choice in Slay the Spire,
        which explains why late games in Slay the Spire bring more intensity as
        players reach their long-term goal.
      </div>

      <div class="main-title">
        Fighting the Chaos
      </div>
      <div class="main-description">
        Comes along the pure randomness the pure chaos. Players' expectation
        would be ruined as the game is totally out of their control. Players
        would easily lose track of what they are doing in the game as what they
        did will prove not applicable for later combats. The solution to this,
        would be balancing the uncertainty brought by the roguelike elements
        while not damaging them meanwhile.
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-title">
        <hr />
        strategy
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">levels</span><br />
        Apparently, levels are not created by a single function -
        CreateRandomLevels(). I would name it semi-random levels since creating
        levels should be designer's work where algorithms are used to repeat
        their design choices. So far as I have noticed, the game tries to keep a
        balance in different routes so you won't meet elites in a row and you
        can hardly find two campfires with nothing in between. And there are
        three certain things in the level:<br />
        - The beginning of each stage is always an encounter against normal
        enemies.<br />
        - On about half way through each stage you will always run into a chest
        room.<br />
        - Before fighting the boss of each stage (which is random) you will
        always be visiting a campfire.<br /><br />
        The first one just sounds reasonable. The last two things really help
        decrease the chaos and let players take a precious rest when they really
        feel need to.
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/analysis/slay-the-spire/spire-1.png" />
          <img src="/media/analysis/slay-the-spire/spire-2.png" />
        </div>
        <span class="element-title">intent system</span><br />
        Intent system is probably the most important feature developers has put
        in the game so far (actually from their talks this is their proudest
        thing). In Slay the Spire's early version, players could not see what
        enemies' next move is, and the result was very frustrating since the
        computer instead of players controls the result of each combat.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/analysis/slay-the-spire/intent.jpg" />
        </div>
        Luckily the designers created the enemies' intent to balance the
        uncertainty.
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-title">
        <hr />
        resources
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        There are by category three kinds of first-level resources in the game
        that adds on to the real combat capability. Money is another very useful
        resource, but it is a second-level resource that needs to be converted
        into first-level resources to make it really work.<br /><br />
        Since each combat is the minimum compartment of a run, most resources
        are used during the combat. There are, on the other hand, some resources
        that could affect different parts of the game.
        <br /><span class="element-title">cards</span> <br />
        Cards are permanent resources that come into effect every combat and
        serve as the most fundamental and important resources in the game. As
        mentioned, players can choose to pick one from three cards to their deck
        after each battle. The game tries to keep the balance between the deck
        and enemies at a dynamic pace.<br /><br />
        Cards' cost and effect in Slay the Spire is a very interesting topic.
        There is believed to be a standard model for basic cards - 1 energy for
        6 attack or 5 defense. If any card fails to exceed this cost-effect
        ratio, it would generally be considered not useful.
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/analysis/slay-the-spire/basic-model.png" />
        </div>
        It is a clear model. But in most cases it is hard to determine the
        effect without putting it under an actual environment. For instance, 1
        energy to draw 3 (4) cards is extremely powerful in late games where you
        have high energy and many cards whose synergy can produce much more than
        one energy, but you probably don't want to have lots of this card in the
        first Phase since your deck is far from stable and powerful. Good thing
        is, there are some easier ways to tweak the balance (roughly).<br /><br />
        There are three basic attributes in a card: cost, rarity, and effect.
        Generally cards with high rarity and cost have better effect. There is
        an inherent balanced between the two, and on the crossroad is the
        trigger limitation. With this in mind, designers could avoid overtuning
        or undertuning cards in a large scale.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/analysis/slay-the-spire/balance.png" />
        </div>
        <span class="element-title">relics</span><br />
        Relics are permanent resources that are triggered passively to influence
        the combat, or to give other one-time benefits. Roguelikes likes to give
        players chances to gain equipments because in most cases, they give
        players <span class="bold">general</span> buff so they can cope with
        everchanging and increasingly difficult levels. Relics are general so
        however players' deck is composed, they are possibly effective, and the
        effect in fact multiples with more relics, not adds up. <br /><br />
        Slay the Spire wants more out of that. There are drops character-only
        relics that specifically powers up a certain character's ability, and
        some seemingly strange ones that are powerful in odd situations.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/analysis/slay-the-spire/relics.png" />
        </div>
        These relics are very contradictory - they can enable a deck, but they
        are useless as well if picked up in late game where the deck doesn't
        need the features any longer.
        <br /><span class="element-title">potions</span><br />
        Potions are consumable resources that are used in the combat. The
        designers want the potions to be more powerful in combats, so they
        actually created a few relics that centers the using of potions.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/analysis/slay-the-spire/potions.png" />
        </div>
        The relic-potion combo may be the most easy-to-understand build in the
        game, but the relics are not so easy to find - especially when you have
        already targeted at one build. Many new players, including me, want a
        build that is strong, stable, and easy to get at the same time. but the
        game teaches us the lesson: everything is changing fast, and adjusting
        the strategy according to the cards and relics received is a must-learn.
        It is just like our life.

        So how to balance such a number of cards? Designers can let players help

          >another title on Gamasutra</a
        >
        about using the player data to balance their game.
        <br /><span class="element-title">why data</span><br />
        Playtesting have been among the highest priority in modern game
        development since games are less like personal expressions but more
        collective commercial products, where catering to players' expectation
        becomes most significant thing. And modern games are enormous - systems,
        programming, animations, sounds... The easiest way to find bugs is just
        to let someone play the game.<br /><br />
        This is especially true in Slay the Spire, the game with only two
        full-time developers. And there are so many cards with different
        abilities. Asking the players to play and treating them as playtesters
        by collecting their in-game data, is a smart move for designers.
        <br /><span class="element-title">metrics</span><br />
        According to the article, the two most important metrics, are "how often
        a player picks a card when given the choice, and how often a card
        appears in a winning deck." From a designer's perspective, every card in
        the game should be unique and function at least under some
        circumstances. But for players, cards have a usage hierarchy and that
        determines if the card is well designed or not: if no one chooses to
        pick up a card, then it is basically not a card in game at that point.
        If a card appears too often in the winning decks, it is probably
        overpowered which also breaks the balance.

        Overall, the game should be fun. The fact that the game is a
        single-player roguelike makes balancing a lot easier than for most
        competitive card games. Players are not competing against each other, so
        decks do not need to be equally powerful, and the designers could make
        changes for entertainment value rather than in the name of pure balance.
        The randomness and deck-building offers major source of fun, while
        balancing the cards ensures the fun is controlled in a reasonable range.
        Chaos and order come dancing together.
