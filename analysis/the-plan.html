        The Plan: An Experiment

      <div class="top-introduction">
        The Plan is a 5-minute-long experience by Krillbite Studio. It is so
        short and special that I can hardly find a similar one to compare - it
        is more like a visual novel with a little interaction. On Steam its
        review has remained "Overwhelmingly Positive" since the release and most
        comments talk about their feeling and thoughts after playing. This game
        absolutely has some magic to attract so many players in just 5 minutes.

          >A fly ascends to the skies, pondering the pointlessness of its brief
          existence.</i
        >
        The story of The Plan is all in this sentence. You play as a fly and all
        you can do is controlling the flying direction. The reason I would
        rather call it "experience" is that it lacks some of the elements that
        make up a game: there is no goal in the game despite the existence of an
        ending, and players face no challenges at all: they could just press one
        key and that is all it takes to finish the game. But at a experience
        level, The Plan also opens many topics worth having deeper discussion.

        story
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">story</span><br />
        The Plan probably has the simplest story ever in video games. Basically
        the player experience the short of life a fly. There is a beginning,
        some obstacles and overcoming (wind and spider web), but all these are
        not strong enough for a compelling experience yet.<br />
        As the fly goes higher and higher, the camera gradually zooms out,
        rendering the fly tiny and unnoticeable. Here is how the game starts to
        get fascinating. In the background a piece of classical music,
        <i>Peer Gynt Suite No. 1, Op. 46: II. The Death of Aase</i> by Edvard
        Grieg, grows louder, and the picture changes from real world scenes to
        metaphor.
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/analysis/the-plan/gameplay-1.jpg" />
          <img src="/media/analysis/the-plan/gameplay-2.jpg" />
        </div>
        Everything just feels so good: who ever has imagined a fly could reach
        stars and galaxy? It feels like the fly is reaching the heaven. The
        orchestra finally rises to the crescendo. <br />
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/analysis/the-plan/gameplay-3.jpg" />
        </div>
        And all of a sudden the fly touches a light bulb and gets killed
        immediately, by which game's description is realized. A fly is just a
        fly, after all. What a great irony!<br />
        <span class="element-title">narrative</span><br />
        Though the game has no reward system or replayability, it does engage
        the players in a narrative way: giving continues positive feedback. The
        fly is always going up, the scene is changing, and bizarre things are
        happening. The game is a non-stop experience with the climate in the
        very end.<br />
        Using positive feedback is helpful for short experiences where player's
        expectation is easier to satisfy. However, for large games that has ups
        and downs like movies, designers must be careful because the pace should
        be changed to let players calm down and take a rest.
        <br /><span class="element-title">openness</span><br />
        The ultimately simple story and the dramatic ending just do a excellent
        job delivering the higher concept of the game. The game is very open for
        understanding: some say it's an experimental deliberation on the meaning
        of life, some say it praises the courage to pursue and explore. The game
        is just like good literature that leaves space for players to think
        about, not just instilling the developer's idea, so that everyone gets
        some inspiration from it.

      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">simplicity</span><br />
        The game's interaction is extremely simple as well: holding a key is
        good enough to finish the game. Just as mentioned above, this weakens
        the feeling that The Plan is a game; but on the other hand, who actually
        cares whether it is a game?

      <div class="main-design-description">
        An open story welcomes vast possibilities. Using rhetoric ways, like
        metaphor works well letting the story speak for itself, and gives
        freedom to players to understand. Simpler in form, more openness and
        complexity in content.

      <div class="main-design-description">
        No games before have a fly as the playable protagonist, and it proves to
        be a very wise choice. In a fly's perspective which no one has probably
        tried before, everything happening is more understandable and as
        audience we are more likely to be open for changes: after all, it is
        just a fly, there is nothing important about it, just show me what you
        imagine.
