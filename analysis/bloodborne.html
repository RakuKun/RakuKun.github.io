        Bloodborne Analysis
      </div>
      <div class="top-introduction">
        Bloodborne is an action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and
        published by Sony Computer Entertainment exclusively for PlayStation 4.
        It is by far the most admired game for me - for its levels, narrative,
        and art. Built in a way similar to other Soul games, Bloodborne does
        have some special points that makes the game different. This analysis
        will focus on Bloodborne's design (level design, system design) and its
        narrative.

        The sentence describes the story of The Plan just as it is. You play as
        a fly and all you can do is controlling its flying direction. The reason
        I would rather call it "experience" is that it lacks some of the
        elements that make up a game: there is no goal in the game despite the
        existence of an ending, and players face no challenges at all: they
        could just press one key and that is all it takes to finish the game.
        But at a experience level, The Plan also opens many topics worth having
        deeper discussion. <span class="important">SPOILERS AHEAD</span>

        You are a fly trying to go up.
        <br />That is what The Plan tells you, making it the simplest story ever
        in video games. It is worth noting that the story here doesn't
        necessarily match what the players comprehend and imagine. And by the
        graphics players are able to know the story at the very beginning,
        making it super clear to know what they should do. <br /><span

        ><br />
        As you fly higher and higher, the game gradually zooms out the camera,
        rendering the fly smaller and smaller. And here comes the music,
        <i>Peer Gynt Suite No. 1, Op. 46: II. The Death of Aase</i>, and there
        is light shining up high. The orcheatra grows louder as the fly ascends.
        And all of a sudden the fly touches a light bulb and gets killed
        immediately. We don't even know that bright light is emitted by the bulb
        before the game ends so it is really kind of surprising. And that's it:
        the game has no reward, or replayability. <br /><span

          >openness</span
        ><br />
        The ultimate simple story and the dramatic ending just do a excellent
        job delivering the higher concept of the game. The game is very open for
        understanding: some say it's an experimental deliberation on the meaning
        of life, some say it praises the courage to pursue and explore. The game
        is just like good literature that leaves space for players to think
        about, not just instilling the developer's idea, so that everyone gets
        some inspiration from it.

        The game's interaction is extremely simple as well: holding a key is
        good enough to finish the game. Just as mentioned above, this weakens
        the feeling that The Plan is a game; but on the other hand, who actually
        cares whether it is a game?

        <i>The Night, and the Dream, were long...</i>
        <br />Bloodborne's story is so complicated that even till today there is
        no universally acknowledged explaination for many details. But it is
        clear and people agree that its world background is constructed upon
        Cthulhu Mythos and there are many new settings. This game takes place in
        Yharnam, a city filled with diseases, blood and death. The city is
        plagued with a local disease which transforms the patients into bestial
        creatures. The player becomes one of the Hunters and hunts down those
        horrifying creatures while exploring the mysterious world of Bloodborne.
        <br /><span class="element-title">theme</span><br />
        In my perspective, the theme of Bloodborne is mankind's evolution.
