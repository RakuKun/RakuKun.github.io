        Bloodborne Analysis

      <div class="top-introduction">
        Bloodborne is an action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and
        published by Sony Computer Entertainment exclusively for PlayStation 4.
        It is so far my most admired game - for its levels, narrative, and art.
        Though seemingly built similar to other Soul games, Bloodborne does have
        some special points that make the game different. This analysis will
        focus on Bloodborne's design (level design, system design) and
        narrative.

        Design
      </div>
      <div class="main-introduction">
        As a game designer, I learn a lot by looking into Bloodborne's design:
        game mechanism, storytelling, world setting, and procedurally generated
        Chalice Dungeons. Of course, many games have very great parts, too, but
        I still prefer Bloodborne most. In my opinion, the difference between
        being "great" and "marvelous" is the ability to internally unite design
        elements: to make everything work well together is more important than
        having a bunch of crazy ideas. Bloodborne really nails it. The two major
        parts of games, level design and system design, make the topic of this
        chapter.<br />
        <span class="important">SPOILERS AHEAD</span>
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-title">
        <hr />
        level design
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">difficulty curve</span><br />
        Just like the soul series made by From Software, the level of Bloodborne
        is beautiful and challenging as well. Waking up in a vast world with few
        hints for where to go next already is already harsh for any players, let
        alone there are numbers of monsters along the way that can kill you in
        three or four blows. <br />
        The way Bloodborne does the tutorial is a quite linear map at the
        beginning where enemies are deadly but also easy to deal with. And
        whatever players do, they will eventually come to a stage where they
        need to face the first storyline boss. It is almost unavoidable that
        many deaths are to come, but that will be a very important lesson for
        players to accept failures and get familiar with the map. It is just
        fair that players use life - usually not very valuable in the early game
        - to learn some basic rules and routines. As the story moves on, the
        game offers more options to choose from and as players have better
        equipment, higher level and more combat experience, it will not be so
        overwhelming. The game in this way ask players in a polite way to think
        carefully and choose a route they feel comfortable, leaving space to
        choose for both new players and veterans.
        <br /><span class="element-title">level's functions</span><br />
        The levels have functions. One of the key things in Bloodborne's map is
        the shortcut which drastically reduces the time needed to travel between
        places. This can have several positive results. <br />
        First, from a feedback perspective, shortcut could ease the negative
        feeling of death because once opened the players don't have to fight
        unnecessary monsters, they can just speedrun. <br />
        Second, from a goal perspective, shortcuts serve as small goals for
        players in their run. Due to the difficulty most people cannot finish
        bosses in one shot, so opening a shortcut whenever entering a new area
        becomes a preferable choice for players. This design as well in the
        experience aspect intrigues player's curiosity and keeps their eyes
        open. <br />
        Third, From Software decompose the large world into smaller areas and
        use shortcuts to connect them all, making them feel larger than they
        really are. Doors, hidden ladders, stairways just make Bloodborne a real
        3-dimensional world connecting the lower and higher places.<br />
        Last but not least, shortcuts are also event triggers for dynamically
        loading map. It takes several seconds to play the open door animation,
        leaving time to load the map of next area.
        <br /><span class="element-title">3-dimensional world</span><br />
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/analysis/bloodborne/shortcut-1.PNG" />
          <img src="/media/analysis/bloodborne/shortcut-2.PNG" />
        </div>
        Bloodborne makes players "WOW" when they finish a long journey and climb
        a ladder just to find themselves right where they wake up! What is more,
        developers still retain control of the level design as the actions the
        character can do are relatively limited, for instance, they can only
        take a leap forward after dashing. So designers can predict where
        players are going. In this way, the level design work is highly
        goal-oriented and risk-controlled.
        <br /><span class="element-title">being gothic</span><br />
        It is not meaningful to analyze the art without putting it under the
        need of level design and storytelling. The gothic, triangular tops of
        buildings help establish navigational landmarks which is friendly to
        players in a misty world. lamps' warm color and the reflection of
        moonlight on the ground also serves as path indicator.

        system design
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">combat system</span><br />
        In the game, Gothic buildings, people's clothing and firearms indicate
        that Bloodborne is based on a Victorian world, a time of technology
        innovation and city lores. Bloodborne offers a much faster combat pace
        for both player and enemy and its combat system is high risk & high
        reward.<br />
        Unlike Soul Series, in Bloodborne there is only a type of wood shield
        available for blocking, so in most cases people do parry and dodge to
        avoid taking damage, which is more time-sensitive and feels more
        intense. Pistol parry, an effective way to make enemies stunned and
        leave space for visceral attack, needs to be done very precisely at the
        moment enemies attack.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/analysis/bloodborne/health.png" alt="Health bar" />
        </div>
        To compliment the faster-paced combat and keep the action fast and
        furious, players can regain some of their lost health if they
        successfully performs counter-attacks. All the designs in combat system
        are in wonderful accordance, and highlight the theme of Bloodborne - the
        lust for blood. We encounter powerful enemies, get killed by them, kill
        them back, and finally the hunter outfit is stained with much blood.
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img
            src="/media/analysis/bloodborne/beast-blood-pellet.jpg"
            alt="Blood Beast Pellet"
          />
          <img src="/media/analysis/bloodborne/beasthood.PNG" alt="Beasthood" />
        </div>
        Another item used to increase the intensity of fighting is Beast Blood
        Pellet which when used boosts player's beast status. Beast status
        increases physical damage and damage taken as well, in order to keep the
        damage boost you have to continue attacking so the meter doesn't fall.
        Due to this design, attacking in beasthood really has a feeling of
        someone slowly turning into a blood-thirsty beast.
        <br /><span class="element-title">insight</span><br />
        <i
          >"The Insight stat represents the depth of inhuman knowledge. Needed
          to ring special bell, but induces frenzy."</i
        ><br />
        Insight is a key attribute which affects lots of in-game events and
        player's other attributes, and I really want to talk about it since it
        is the core setting of Bloodborne. Basically the higher Insight
        character possesses, the more they are exposed to inhuman knowledge, and
        the more this world reveals itself. If Blood Echo is the currency to buy
        more for the character, Insight is the currency for knowing about
        Bloodborne's world.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/analysis/bloodborne/lesser-amygdala.jpg" />
        </div>
        One example: when Insight reaches 40, Lesser Amygdala become visible in
        the Cathedral Ward and other areas. The game uses such explicit way to
        demonstrate Insight's power: it is really affecting how the character
        and player observes the world, far beyond changing some attribute's
        value.

        <i>The Night, and the Dream, were long...</i>
        <br />Even till today, there is no universally acknowledged explanation
        for even all three endings. One reason is Bloodborne's world setting is
        highly fantastic and hybrid. Nevertheless, people do agree on the fact
        that its backstory is constructed upon Cthulhu Mythos but with much
        unique setting. This game takes place in Yharnam, a city plagued
        diseases, blood craze and death. The disease in the city transforms
        human victims into bestial creatures. The player acts as one of the
        Hunters and hunts down those horrifying creatures while exploring the
        buried backstory of Yharnam. <br />
        <span class="element-title">theme</span><br />
        In my perspective, the theme of Bloodborne, if there must be just one,
        is mankind's evolution.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img
            src="/media/analysis/bloodborne/moon-presence.jpg"
            alt="Moon Presence"
          />
        </div>
        We could analyze its theme by looking into three endings which is all
        related to a secret endboss, the Moon Presence.<br />
        1. In "Yharnam Sunrise", the character "lives the hunt" and awakens in
        real world where Yharnam embraces a new morning. This is the easiest
        ending as there is no need to fight any boss further than Mergo's
        Wetnurse. The character finishes the mission assigned and makes a fair
        deal with the watcher of the hunter's dream and leaves. Everything is
        back on track as if nothing really happened during that night.<br />
        2. In "Honouring Wishes", the character is "captivated by the Moon
        Presence" and takes over Gehrman's place to "watch over the hunter's
        dream". This ending shows the condition where the character wants to
        fight against the current situation and get rid of someone else's
        control, but they are just not strong enough to finish it and become the
        next miserable watcher. <br />
        3. In "Childhood's Beginning", the character defeats the Moon Presence
        and "became an infant Great One, lifting humanity into its next
        childhood". This end is only possible after the character has consumed
        at least three pieces of One Third of Umbilical Cord which gives human
        the power of Great Ones.<br />
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/analysis/bloodborne/endings.png" />
        </div>
        As the description tells, the three endings are basically stats that
        identifies the character's (and player's) acknowledge of the essence of
        this world and the willingness to change it.
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-title">
        <hr />
        narrative design
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">storytelling</span><br />
        Bloodborne's story is hard to understand partly because of its way of
        storytelling. Bloodborne never "tells" the details of a story. For most
        times, it gives player a start and a goal, and do the rest of
        storytelling sorely in environment, dialogues, and item descriptions.
        One must be very patient and careful not to omit the little evidence of
        the possible existence of backstory. And it only gives fragments of the
        story, so the work of putting fragmented information together into a
        story is left to players. In this sense, the story of Bloodborne is very
        open as everyone has their own explanation: this is just how I
        understand from the incomplete information provided.
