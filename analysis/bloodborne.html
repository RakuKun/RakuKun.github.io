        Bloodborne Analysis

      <div class="top-introduction">
        Bloodborne is an action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and
        published by Sony Computer Entertainment exclusively for PlayStation 4.
        It is by far the most admired game for me - for its levels, narrative,
        and art. Built in a way similar to other Soul games, Bloodborne does
        have some special points that makes the game different. This analysis
        will focus on Bloodborne's design (level design, system design) and its
        narrative.

        Design
      </div>
      <div class="main-introduction">
        As a game designer, I find in Bloodborne too many things to learn from:
        game mechanism, storytelling, world settings, and procedually generated
        Chalice Dungeons. Of course, many games have very great parts, too, but
        I still prefer Bloodborne most. In my opinion, the difference between
        being "great" and "marvelous" is the ability to internally unite design
        elements: to make everything work well together is more important than
        having a bunch of crazy ideas. Bloodborne does great in this aspect. In
        this part I will be talking mainly about their design approach.

        level design

        <span class="element-title">simplicity</span><br />
        Just like the soul series made by From Software, the level of Bloodborne
        is beautiful and challenging as well. Waking up in a vast world with few
        hints for where to go next already seems hard enough for new players,
        let alone there are numbers of monsters along the way. But we do have
        some good news. The structure of Bloodborne's level is quite linear at
        the beginning and will only grow into branches once players get the hang
        of the game. And whatever players do, they will eventually come to a
        point where they need to face the first progress boss. It is almost
        unavoidable that many deaths are to come, but that will be a very
        important lesson for players to accept failures and get familiar with
        the map. It is just fair that players use life - usually not very
        valuable in the early game - to learn some basic rules and routines. As
        the story moves on, the game offers more options to choose from and as
        players have better equipment, higher level and more battle experience,
        it will not be so overwhelming. The game in this way ask "politely"
        players to think carefully and choose a route they feel comfortable,
        leaving space to choose for both new players and veterans.
        <br /><span class="element-title">level's functions</span><br />
        The levels have functions. One crucial thing for Bloodborne's map is the
        shortcut which drastically reduces the time needed to travel between
        places and it serves well. First, the designers of Bloodborne use the
        shortcut to ease the negative feeling of death. The shortcut is a small
        goal for players to challenge themselves to prove deaths not in vain. if
        the player opens a shortcut during the adventure, even if he/she dies
        he/she would not feel too depressed because next time the player can
        travel the world more efficiently. This design as well in the experience
        aspect intrigues player's curiosity and keeps their eyes open. Secondly,
        From Software decompose the large world into smaller areas and use
        shortcuts to connect them all, making them feel larger than they really
        are. Doors, hidden ladders, stairways just make Bloodborne a real
        3-dimensional world connecting the lower world and higher places.
        Bloodborne makes players "WOW" when they take a long journey and climb a
        ladder just to find themselves in front of their wake up location! What
        is more, developers still hold control of the level design as the
        actions character can do are relatively limited - no jumping, only dash
        jumping when triggered. So designers can make precise prediction about
        where players are going so the work is highly goal-oriented and well
        controlled.
        <br /><span class="element-title">openness</span><br />
        Not every game has that elaborately polished map design - I would rather
        call it the genius gift - it is not meaningful to analyze the map
        structure without putting it under the need of art style and
        storytelling.

      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">combat system</span><br />
        It is hard to discuss Bloodborne's combat system without comparing it to
        Souls series as they share almost identical combat designing. But there
        is difference which shapes what is called Bloodborne, not "Dark Souls
        Victoria". In the game, Gothic buildings, people's clothing and firearms
        indicate that Bloodborne is based on a Victorian world, a time of
        technology innovation and city lores. Bloodborne offers a much faster
        combat pace for both player and enemy. There is only one wooden shield
        available for blocking, so in most cases it is better to parry and dodge
        to avoid taking damage. Firearms are most suitable to parry enemy's
        attack, making them stagger and vulnerable to deadly counter-attacks. To
        compliment the faster-paced combat and keep the action fast and furious,
        players can regain some of their lost health if they successfully
        performs counter-attacks. All the designs in combat system are in
        wonderful accordance, and highlight the theme of Bloodborne - the lust
        for blood. We encounter powerful enemies, get killed by them, kill them
        back, and finally the hunter outfit is stained with much blood.

      <div class="main-introduction">
        Like other titles of Soul series, Bloodborne has very stylized From

        <i>The Night, and the Dream, were long...</i>
        <br />Bloodborne's story is so complicated that even till today there is
        no universally acknowledged explaination for many details. But it is
        clear and people agree that its world background is constructed upon
        Cthulhu Mythos and there are many new settings. This game takes place in
        Yharnam, a city filled with diseases, blood and death. The city is
        plagued with a local disease which transforms the patients into bestial
        creatures. The player becomes one of the Hunters and hunts down those
        horrifying creatures while exploring the mysterious world of Bloodborne.
        <br /><span class="element-title">theme</span><br />
        In my perspective, the theme of Bloodborne is mankind's evolution.
