        <span class="element-title">difficulty curve</span><br />
        Just like the soul series made by From Software, the level of Bloodborne
        is beautiful and challenging as well. Waking up in a vast world with few
        hints for where to go next already is already harsh for any players, let
        alone there are numbers of monsters along the way that can kill you in
        three or four blows. <br />
        The way Bloodborne does the tutorial is a quite linear map at the
        beginning where enemies are deadly but also easy to deal with. And
        whatever players do, they will eventually come to a stage where they
        need to face the first storyline boss. It is almost unavoidable that
        many deaths are to come, but that will be a very important lesson for
        players to accept failures and get familiar with the map. It is just
        fair that players use life - usually not very valuable in the early game
        - to learn some basic rules and routines. As the story moves on, the
        game offers more options to choose from and as players have better
        equipment, higher level and more combat experience, it will not be so
        overwhelming. The game in this way ask players in a polite way to think
        carefully and choose a route they feel comfortable, leaving space to
        choose for both new players and veterans.
        <br /><span class="element-title">level's functions</span><br />
        The levels have functions. One of the key things in Bloodborne's map is
        the shortcut which drastically reduces the time needed to travel between
        places. This can have several positive results. <br />
        First, from a feedback perspective, shortcut could ease the negative
        feeling of death because once opened the players don't have to fight
        unnecessary monsters, they can just speedrun. <br />
        Second, from a goal perspective, shortcuts serve as small goals for
        players in their run. Due to the difficulty most people cannot finish
        bosses in one shot, so opening a shortcut whenever entering a new area
        becomes a preferable choice for players. This design as well in the
        experience aspect intrigues player's curiosity and keeps their eyes
        open. <br />
        Third, From Software decompose the large world into smaller areas and
        use shortcuts to connect them all, making them feel larger than they
        really are. Doors, hidden ladders, stairways just make Bloodborne a real
        3-dimensional world connecting the lower and higher places.<br />
        Last but not least, shortcuts are also event triggers for dynamically
        loading map. It takes several seconds to play the open door animation,
        leaving time to load the map of next area.
