        INSIDE: Design & Visual
      </div>
      <div class="top-introduction">
        INSIDE is a puzzle-platformer adventure game developed and published by
        Playdead in 2016. The highly stylish graphics makes this small game feel
        emotional, and its design especially narrative part works well in
        telling a dystopian story without words.

        Design and Narrative

      <div class="main-introduction">
        INSIDE is more than just a puzzle-platformer in ways that it has a
        complete story.

      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">simple scene</span><br />
        Each scene in INSIDE is connected by puzzles, usually at most one puzzle
        for one scene. So the puzzle in form is not connected, and as the result
        each is not very complicated. INSIDE makes its puzzles feel "connected"
        with the continuity of the world and items - like the submarine in
        underwater levels.
        <span class="element-title">types of puzzle</span><br />
        Generally there are two prospective to start thinking of puzzles: making
        difficult one that offers unlimited time for thinking, and simpler one
        that requires correct input under time limitation. The two kinds of
        puzzles could balance the game difficulty and serve the narrative: when
        the character faces a puzzle where no one is here, it could be rather
        large scaled and complicated. If he is being chased by a hound, the
        puzzle is more like an adventure as time for reaction is short as he
        keeps running. After all, puzzle design serves the story. If it is
        annoyingly hard the story flow will be interrupted.

        narrative
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">storytelling</span><br />
        Almost a direct contrast to text-rich game like Firewatch, INSIDE tells
        the story using only environment. The approach is suitable for players
        who likes the openness of the narrative, but not those who prefer a
        clear explanation - all except developers can only guess what the story
        is, but probably never 100% clear.
        <span class="element-title">pace</span><br />
        INSIDE keeps its pace balanced by adding transition scenes between
        puzzles: the character would walk a little bit after solving a puzzle
        and before running into a new one. Like mentioned above, time
        constrained puzzles offers more nervosity while unlimited time puzzle is
        a good chance to calm down

      <div class="main-introduction">
        The graphics in INSIDE is impressive - it keeps Limbo's dark ambience,
        but with the transition from black-white to fully colored world, the
        game has much stronger feeling of a dystopian world.

      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">desaturated world</span><br />
        Everything in INSIDE has less saturated color than normal, and this
        feels like we are seeing the world through fog, which matches feeling of
        a dystopian world.<br />

      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        Everything in INSIDE is not complicated in shape, what makes it feel
        good to watch is the good use of contrast and pattern.
        <br /><span class="element-title">contrast</span><br />
        No games before have a fly as the playable protagonist, and it proves to
        be a very wise choice.
        <br /><span class="element-title">pattern</span><br />
        Pattern is the group of shapes.
