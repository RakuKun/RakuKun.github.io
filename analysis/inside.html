        INSIDE is a puzzle-platformer adventure game developed and published by
        Playdead in 2016.

          existence.</i
        ><br />
        The sentence describes the story of The Plan. You play as a fly and all
        you can do is controlling where it goes. The reason I would rather call
        it "experience" is that it lacks some of the elements that make up a
        game: there is no goal in the game despite of the existence of an
        ending, and players have no challenges at all: they could just press one
        key and that is all it takes to finish the game. But at an experiential
        level, The Plan also opens many topics worth having deeper discussion.

      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">simplicity</span><br />
        You are a fly trying to go up.
        <br />That is what The Plan tells you, making it the simplest story ever
        in video games. It is worth noting that the story here doesn't
        necessarily match what the players comprehend and imagine. And by the
        graphics players are able to know the story at the very beginning,
        making it super clear to know what they should do. <br /><span

          >ending</span
        ><br />
        As you fly higher and higher, the game gradually zooms out the camera,
        rendering the fly smaller and smaller. And here comes the music,
        <i>Peer Gynt Suite No. 1, Op. 46: II. The Death of Aase</i>, and there
        is light shining up high. The orchestra grows louder as the fly ascends.
        And all of a sudden the fly touches a light bulb and gets killed
        immediately. We don't even know that bright light is emitted by the bulb
        before the game ends so it is really kind of surprising. And that's it:
        the game has no reward, or replayability. <br /><span
          class="element-title"
          >openness</span
        ><br />
        The ultimate simple story and the dramatic ending just do a excellent
        job delivering the higher concept of the game. The game is very open for
        understanding: some say it's an experimental deliberation on the meaning
        of life, some say it praises the courage to pursue and explore. The game
        is just like good literature that leaves space for players to think
        about, not just instilling the developer's idea, so that everyone gets
        some inspiration from it.

      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">simplicity</span><br />
        The game's interaction is extremely simple as well: holding a key is
        good enough to finish the game. Just as mentioned above, this weakens
        the feeling that The Plan is a game; but on the other hand, who actually
        cares whether it is a game?

      <div class="main-introduction">
        The graphics in INSIDE is impressive - it keeps Limbo's dark ambience,
        but with the transition from black-white to fully color graphics, the
        game has much stronger feeling of a dystopian world.

        <span class="element-title">desaturated world</span><br />
        Everything in INSIDE has less saturated color than normal, and this
        feels like we are seeing the world through fog, which matches feeling of
        a dystopian world.

        No games before have a fly as the playable protagonist, and it proves to
        be a very wise choice.
