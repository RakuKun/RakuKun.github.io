        INSIDE: Design and Visual
      </div>
      <div class="top-introduction">
        INSIDE is a puzzle-platformer adventure game developed and published by
        Playdead in 2016. The highly stylish graphics makes this small game feel
        emotional, and its design especially narrative part works well in
        telling a dystopian story without words.

        Design and Narrative
      </div>
      <div class="main-description">
        INSIDE goes beyond puzzle-platformers by telling a thrilling and
        open-ended story.
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-title">

        puzzle design

      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">simple scene</span><br />
        Each scene in INSIDE is connected by puzzles, usually at most one puzzle
        for one scene. So the puzzle in form is not connected, and as the result
        each is not very complicated. INSIDE makes its puzzles feel "connected"
        with the continuity of the world and items - like the submarine in
        underwater levels.<br />
        <span class="element-title">puzzle types</span><br />
        Generally there are two prospective to start thinking of puzzles: making
        difficult one that offers unlimited time for thinking, and simpler one
        that requires correct input under time limitation. The two kinds of
        puzzles could balance the game difficulty and serve the narrative: when
        the character faces a puzzle where no one is here, it could be rather
        large scaled and complicated. If he is being chased by a hound, the
        puzzle is more like an adventure as time for reaction is short as he
        keeps running. After all, puzzle design serves the story. If it is
        annoyingly hard the story flow will be interrupted.
      </div>

        narrative
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">storytelling</span><br />
        Almost a direct contrast to text-rich game like Firewatch, INSIDE tells
        the story using only environment. The approach is suitable for players
        who likes the openness of the narrative, but not those who prefer a
        clear explanation - all except developers can only guess what the story
        is, but probably never 100% clear.<br />
        <span class="element-title">pace</span><br />
        INSIDE keeps its pace balanced by adding transition scenes between
        puzzles: the character would walk a little bit after solving a puzzle
        and before running into a new one. Like mentioned above, time
        constrained puzzles offers more nervosity while unlimited time puzzle is
        a good chance to slow down the pace and is a good save point.

        Visual

      <div class="main-description">
        The graphics in INSIDE is impressive - it keeps Limbo's dark ambience,
        but with the transition from black-white to fully colored world, the
        game has much stronger feeling of a dystopian world.
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-title">

        color
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">desaturated world</span><br />
        Everything in INSIDE has less saturated color than normal, and this
        feels like we are seeing the world through fog, which matches feeling of
        a dystopian world.<br />
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/analysis/inside/color-1.jpg" />
          <img src="/media/analysis/inside/color-2.jpg" />
        </div>
        Warm colors generally give a feeling of hope and empowered. However,
        even in rare occasions in INSIDE where we can see warm lights, it is
        hard to feel the character's situation is getting better. The reasons is
        that first, the warm color is much less saturated than it should be
        naturally; second, the scene is blurred, indicating a unknown and
        fragile hope.

        shape
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        Everything in INSIDE is not complicated in shape, what makes it feel
        good to watch is the good use of contrast and pattern. INSIDE is
        successful in using large shape volume and darker color to make the
        feeling of distance between the boy and the machine world.
        <br /><span class="element-title">contrast</span><br />
        INSIDE uses highly contrasted graphics to help add ambience to its
        story. One of the basic combination is darkness and light. Darkness
        means unknown and danger and makes major part in background and the path
        ahead. Light means certainty and hope so is shown for hints around the
        character. However, the neon light from a dark panel serves as one of
        the exceptions where light can also be evil.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/analysis/inside/contrast-1.jpg" />
        </div>
        Loneliness is also everywhere in the game. In the picture above the boy
        drives a submarine whose light is pointing at a naked figure with long
        hair (it). It is dangerous but afraid of light, so to beat the level
        player needs to control the boy and the direction of light so it is
        always lighting it. In this strange situation, the light connects the
        only two characters lone in the level, yet they keep a hostile
        relationship. Such scene really triggers the inner loneliness of me.
        <br /><span class="element-title">pattern</span><br />
        Pattern is the group of shapes. INSIDE uses the arrangement of repeated
        shapes to show the characteristic of a dystopian world.
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/analysis/inside/pattern-1.jpg" />
          <img src="/media/analysis/inside/pattern-2.jpg" />
        </div>
        These two pictures depict a place where human figures are eerily hanged
        inside some fluid. The composition is strange in nature as the fluid
        seems floating not affected by the gravity force. The pattern of human
        figure and machines there makes the scene even scarier, indicating the
        large scale of human experiment.
