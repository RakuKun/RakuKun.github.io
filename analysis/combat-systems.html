      <div class="top-introduction">
        Of all types of game fantasies, brawling with enemies controlling
        fictional characters has really stood out and pushed the envelope of
        many new game mechanics. Melee combat systems are regarded as a core
        part of a considerable amount of games with lots of supporting gameplay
        systems revolving around it. This article will break down the combat
        systems of three typical action games: Bloodborne, the new God of War,
        and Monster Hunter: World.

      <div class="main-description">
        Analyzing the combat system in any of contemporary action games feels
        like a daunting task. I find it useful in many times to apply the MDA
        Framework that starts with breaking down the verbs of in-game actions
        that convey certain degree of feelings, and then goes deeper on combat
        system's components, and ultimately the base level of how everything is
        integrated into a complete system.<br /><br />
        In this section I'll be mainly using the examples of the three games
        mentioned above, not only because I'm most familiar with these games,
        and they represent different ways to approach the same goal: make the
        combat system fun and challenging.

        defining success

      <div class="main-design-description">
        Many great action games feature its combat system as a fundamental
        selling point. However, nowadays many players are being more aware of
        the "integration" of the game, reminding us developers the importance of
        making everything fit in. That's to say, a good combat system should be
        in harmony of the game's other systems that altogether creates the
        illusion of being in the game world.

      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">difficulty curve</span><br />
        Just like the soul series made by From Software, the level of Bloodborne
        is beautiful and challenging as well. Waking up in a vast world with few
        hints for where to go next already is already harsh for any players, let
        alone there are numbers of monsters along the way that can kill you in
        three or four blows. <br />
        The way Bloodborne does the tutorial is a quite linear map at the
        beginning where enemies are deadly but also easy to deal with. And
        whatever players do, they will eventually come to a stage where they
        need to face the first storyline boss. It is almost unavoidable that
        many deaths are to come, but that will be a very important lesson for
        players to accept failures and get familiar with the map. It is just
        fair that players use life - usually not very valuable in the early game
        - to learn some basic rules and routines. As the story moves on, the
        game offers more options to choose from and as players have better
        equipment, higher level and more combat experience, it will not be so
        overwhelming. The game in this way ask players in a polite way to think
        carefully and choose a route they feel comfortable, leaving space to
        choose for both new players and veterans.
        <br /><span class="element-title">level's functions</span><br />
        The levels have functions. One of the key things in Bloodborne's map is
        the shortcut which drastically reduces the time needed to travel between
        places. This can have several positive results. <br />
        First, from a feedback perspective, shortcut could ease the negative
        feeling of death because once opened the players don't have to fight
        unnecessary monsters, they can just speedrun. <br />
        Second, from a goal perspective, shortcuts serve as small goals for
        players in their run. Due to the difficulty most people cannot finish
        bosses in one shot, so opening a shortcut whenever entering a new area
        becomes a preferable choice for players. This design as well in the
        experience aspect intrigues player's curiosity and keeps their eyes
        open. <br />
        Third, From Software decompose the large world into smaller areas and
        use shortcuts to connect them all, making them feel larger than they
        really are. Doors, hidden ladders, stairways just make Bloodborne a real
        3-dimensional world connecting the lower and higher places.<br />
        Last but not least, shortcuts are also event triggers for dynamically
        loading map. It takes several seconds to play the open door animation,
        leaving time to load the map of next area.
        <br /><span class="element-title">3-dimensional world</span><br />
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/analysis/bloodborne/shortcut-1.PNG" />
          <img src="/media/analysis/bloodborne/shortcut-2.PNG" />
        </div>
        Bloodborne makes players "WOW" when they finish a long journey and climb
        a ladder just to find themselves right where they wake up! What is more,
        developers still retain control of the level design as the actions the
        character can do are relatively limited, for instance, they can only
        take a leap forward after dashing. So designers can predict where
        players are going. In this way, the level design work is highly
        goal-oriented and risk-controlled.
        <br /><span class="element-title">being gothic</span><br />
        I believe that art style should serve the game settings and
        storytelling. The gothic, triangular tops of buildings help establish
        navigational landmarks which is friendly to players in a misty world.
        lamps' warm color and the reflection of moonlight on the ground also
        serves as path indicator.
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-title">

        system design
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">combat system</span><br />
        In the game, Gothic buildings, people's clothing and firearms indicate
        that Bloodborne is based on a Victorian world, a time of technology
        innovation and city lores. Bloodborne offers a much faster combat pace
        for both player and enemy and its combat system is high risk & high
        reward.<br />
        Unlike Soul Series, in Bloodborne there is only a type of wood shield
        available for blocking, so in most cases people do parry and dodge to
        avoid taking damage, which is more time-sensitive and feels more
        intense. Pistol parry, a very effective way to make enemies stunned and
        leave space for high-damage visceral attacking, needs to be done very
        precisely at the moment enemies attack, or the enemy will use their
        attacks to punish the player harshly.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/analysis/bloodborne/health.png" alt="Health bar" />
        </div>
        Another very interesting setting is the Rally mechanism. It is a
        risk/reward combat mechanic that after being hit by an enemy, players
        may jump back in the action and attack the opponent to quickly refill
        any lost health before the health bar actually depletes the amount. The
        tricky thing is that any follow-up attacks you take will negate the
        chance to regain the former losing health. So timing is crucial to the
        execution of this mechanic. This setting really challenges the players
        as attacking back boldly but also avoiding getting another hit is a hard
        lesson for everyone.
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img
            src="/media/analysis/bloodborne/beast-blood-pellet.jpg"
            alt="Blood Beast Pellet"
          />
          <img src="/media/analysis/bloodborne/beasthood.PNG" alt="Beasthood" />
        </div>
        There is an item especially designed to increase the intensity of
        fighting: Beast Blood Pellet, which when used boosts player's beast
        status. Beast status increases physical damage and damage taken as well,
        in order to keep the damage boost you have to continue attacking so the
        meter doesn't fall. Due to this design, attacking in beasthood really
        has a feeling of someone slowly turning into a blood-thirsty beast.
        <br />All the designs in combat system share a same clear goal: to
        promote a much more aggressive style for combat where the meaning of
        Bloodborne is revealed: We encounter powerful enemies, get killed by
        them, kill them back, and finally the hunter outwears are stained with
        blood. <br /><span class="element-title">Insight</span><br />
        <i
          >"The Insight stat represents the depth of inhuman knowledge. Needed
          to ring special bell, but induces frenzy."</i
        ><br />
        Insight is a key attribute which affects lots of in-game events and
        player's other attributes, and I really want to talk about it since it
        is the core setting of Bloodborne. Basically the higher Insight
        character possesses, the more they are exposed to inhuman knowledge, and
        the more this world reveals itself. If Blood Echo is the currency to buy
        more for the character, Insight is the currency for knowing about
        Bloodborne's world.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/analysis/bloodborne/lesser-amygdala.jpg" />
        </div>
        One example: when Insight reaches 40, Lesser Amygdala become visible in
        the Cathedral Ward and other areas. The game uses such explicit way to
        demonstrate Insight's power: it is really affecting how the character
        and player observes the world, far beyond changing some attribute's
        value.

        <i>"The Night, and the Dream, were long..."</i>
        <br />Even till today, there is no universally acknowledged explanation
        for even all three endings. One reason is Bloodborne's world setting is
        highly fantastic and hybrid. Nevertheless, people do agree on the fact
        that its backstory is constructed upon Cthulhu Mythos but with much
        unique setting. This game takes place in Yharnam, a city plagued
        diseases, blood craze and death. The disease in the city transforms
        human victims into bestial creatures. The player acts as one of the
        Hunters and hunts down those horrifying creatures while exploring the
        buried backstory of Yharnam. <br />
        <span class="element-title">theme</span><br />
        In my perspective, the theme of Bloodborne, if there must be just one,
        is mankind's evolution.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img
            src="/media/analysis/bloodborne/moon-presence.jpg"
            alt="Moon Presence"
          />
        </div>
        We could analyze its theme by looking into three endings which is all
        related to a secret endboss, the Moon Presence.<br />
        1. In "Yharnam Sunrise", the character "lives the hunt" and awakens in
        real world where Yharnam embraces a new morning. This is the easiest
        ending as there is no need to fight any boss further than Mergo's
        Wetnurse. The character finishes the mission assigned and makes a fair
        deal with the watcher of the hunter's dream and leaves. Everything is
        back on track as if nothing really happened during that night.<br />
        2. In "Honouring Wishes", the character is "captivated by the Moon
        Presence" and takes over Gehrman's place to "watch over the hunter's
        dream". This ending shows the condition where the character wants to
        fight against the current situation and get rid of someone else's
        control, but they are just not strong enough to finish it and become the
        next miserable watcher. <br />
        3. In "Childhood's Beginning", the character defeats the Moon Presence
        and "became an infant Great One, lifting humanity into its next
        childhood". This end is only possible after the character has consumed
        at least three pieces of One Third of Umbilical Cord which gives human
        the power of Great Ones.<br />
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/analysis/bloodborne/endings.png" />
        </div>
        As the description tells, the three endings are basically stats that
        identifies the character's (and player's) acknowledge of the essence of
        this world and the willingness to change it.
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-title">

        narrative design
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">storytelling</span><br />
        Bloodborne's story is hard to understand partly because of its way of
        storytelling. Bloodborne never "tells" the details of a story. For most
        times, it gives player a start and a goal, and do the rest of
        storytelling sorely in environment, dialogues, and item descriptions.
        One must be very patient and careful not to omit the little evidence of
        the possible existence of backstory. And it only gives fragments of the
        story, so the work of putting fragmented information together into a
        story is left to players. In this sense, the story of Bloodborne is very
        open as everyone has their own explanation: this is just how I
        understand from the incomplete information provided.
