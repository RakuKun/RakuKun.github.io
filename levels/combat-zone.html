        Designing engaging multiplayer FPS combat experiences have alway been a
        very interesting topic to me. This page covers the process of designing
        both a symmetrical and an asymmetrical 1v1 FPS combat level using
        concepts like choke points, covers, lines of sight, and combat
        distances.

        I was spending quite a bit time during my summer and winter 2020
        vacations watching some top streamers on Twitch playing Call of Duty:
        Warzone (battle royale). Among many interesting game mechanics, the
        desperate 1v1 gunfight in a fictional gulag attracted me most for its
        dramatically fast-paced combat and the cruel rule that only the winner
        can step back into the battlefield again.

        <span class="element-title">what's gulag?</span><br />
        As a Battle Royale game, Call of Duty: Warzone is praised for its
        fast-paced and the consistent Call-of-Duty feeling. A player is put into
        the gulag if and only after they get killed in the game for the first
        time, and the gulag is a chance for them to push back to the main game -
        if they manage to win their opponents.<br /><br />
        A one versus one fight is prepared for everyone in the gulag, and some
        special rules apply: the system will pick a gun (or not!) randomly for
        both sides, and/or some equipments such as flash grenades or C4. The
        health does not regenerate here, and each round only has 40 seconds,
        with a "overtime" setting where players can also capture the flag in the
        middle of the map to win.
        <br />

        <br /><span class="element-title">why gulag?</span><br />
        The gulag is designed, along with many other unique systems in Warzone,
        in order that players can MAXIMIZE their playtime in the game and keep
        excited. Similar to the main game where TTK (time to kill) is relatively
        short compared to other Battle Royale games, gunfights in gulag also try
        to make battle short and exciting. The higher the risk, the better the
        reward.<br /><br />
        In the gulag map, many factors work successfully together to make the
        gunfight fast and intense. I want to discuss how designers achieve their
        goals by looking into the 2d and 3d layout of the map.

        <span class="element-title">symmetrical maps: 2d</span><br />
        When Warzone was first released, according to the official guide, the
        1v1 gunfight can take place randomly at one of the following three maps.
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/levels/combat-zone/gulag-1.jpg" />
          <img src="/media/levels/combat-zone/gulag-2.jpg" />
          <img src="/media/levels/combat-zone/gulag-3.jpg" />
        </div>
        The three maps do have different layouts.<br />
        The first map has the walls on both left and right side of the u-shaped
        wall offer a great cover when players are trying to engage in a
        long-range gunfight. However, trying to capture the flag in this map
        will be a bit scary since the flag is located totally in the open.
        Crossing the middle lane would be a bold action.<br />
        The second map features a circular stall in the middle which could be
        used to cut down sightlines for a close-range combat. This map is also
        if the player wants to play more defensively - the rectangular walls
        offers covers for long-range gunfights.<br />
        The third map offers the longest sightlines through a very narrow aisle
        on top and bottom and the map, making it a great map for long-range
        fights. On the other side, the blocks in the mioddle also provide the
        close-range combat option if the players have shotguns.<br /><br />
        From 2d layouts we can find the three maps share some things in
        common:<br />
        <span class="bold">- Rigidly axial symmetric layouts.</span> The
        Symmetric map layouts ensure that both sides are in a strictly equal
        competitive environment, and the win or lose is really only depending on
        individual skills. However, such maps may be a little bit short in terms
        of tactical strategies, because both sides ideally will do the same
        actions and it's really up to their shooting skills.<br />
        <span class="bold"
          >- Single-floor, small map with lots of obstacles blocking the
          sight.</span
        >
        From the purpose of the Gulag, we know that designers want this combat
        to be quick and decisive, which pushes the map to be simple and
        understandable as possible. But being simple does not means being easy:
        the players should be put into a challenging enough environment where
        they need to use everything they're provided to win.<br />
        <span class="bold"
          >- Option for both long-range and close-range combats. </span
        >In the Gulag the players are given randomly the same
        pistols/shotguns/rifles etc., and all three map layouts fit most
        weapons. The blockouts have some long sightlines and at the same time
        put the flag in the very middle of the map, making capturing the flag
        probably the most dangerous thingto do there. The flags are more likely
        to be used as baits if one side wants to trigger a close-range gunfight
        and put the enemy in a relatively passive position. <br />
        <span class="bold"
          >- A perimeter balcony above where idle players can observe the
          ground. </span
        >No doubt this design gives advantage to the players who have teammates
        in the same jail. It is a really interesting design to keep players from
        the waiting boredom that allows some teamworking in an uncommon
        situation. <br />

        <span class="element-title">symmetrical maps: 3d</span><br />
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/levels/combat-zone/gulag-3d.jpg" />
        </div>
        One very important design I found about the three gulag map is that,
        most walls are so TALL that players cannot peek upwards, but have to
        peek left/right, which adds to the odds they get killed.<br />
        This design again forces the players to take higher risks in the fight,
        by moving closer to the enemy or exposing a larger part of the body.
        <br /><span class="element-title">asymmetrical map</span>
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/levels/combat-zone/gulag-4.jpg" />
          <img src="/media/levels/combat-zone/gulag-5.png" />
        </div>
        On December 16th, As part of the Season One content from Black Ops Cold
        War, the game introduced two new maps for the Gulag, including an
        asymmetrically-designed map: Verdansk. This map is very interesting
        because it broke the convention of symmetrical maps used for the Gulag,
        and therefore, the gunfights will be a bit more tactical there. I drew
        the 2d map above myself according to the 3d map.<br /><br />
        <span class="element-title">routes and choke points</span><br />
        Among all possibilities, there are ultimately three player routes
        divided by a truck and an empty container with holes, and the players
        spawn at the opposite corners on the map. The following images describe
        the choke points in the upper and lower routes.
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/levels/combat-zone/gulag-path-1.png" />
          <img src="/media/levels/combat-zone/gulag-path-2.png" />
        </div>
        For the first route: for the blue player, the natural strategy would be
        going right along the container and peek through the holes, as that's a
        safer way than to go to the other side of the truck, and the fact that
        most right-handed players tend to go to the right side. The red player
        arrives just a bit earlier at the choke point and can pre-aim the blue
        player. For one-shot weapons like shotgun, the win is really just on who
        fires earlier. However, peeking through the holes is in a bit favor of
        the blue player who has just a bit better sight than the red player,
        making this path balanced with long-range weapons. <br />
        The the second route: either side wants to take the risk of traversing
        all the way along the truck and as the chances are high to meet the
        opponent in the middle way, which leads to a 50-50 gunfight that's
        essentially on who aims better, so the engagement there would be from
        long distance. It will takes some time for the blue player to get to the
        edge of the truck while the red player can almost aim at the spawn
        point, so naturally it will be a bit in favor of the red player.
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/levels/combat-zone/gulag-path-3.png" />
        </div>
        The third route seems to be the most balanced situation where both sides
        just choose to go middle and take advantage of the covers there while
        engaged in a mid-range combat. The real problem is, the covers are too
        low, essentially exposing half of the player's body. In the real world
        scenario, players would more likely to use the truck/container as their
        cover and again fight from distance.<br /><br />

        There is choke point in each player path. Holes on two sides of the
        empty container make this area a choke point in this small map. The cars
        and trucks can turn into choke points in some combat. But at a larger
        sense, this map is still pretty balanced because the covers and spawn
        positions are not favoring either side. After all, in the Gulag in
        Warzone, every kill happens so fast that if one wants to win, they must
        get their shots in. Having an asymmetrical map definitely adds some
        freshness to the both sides and sometimes people just like to blame on
        objective things: "this map is in favor of my opponent and that's why I
        lost!"

        My standard for designing a small 1v1 gunfight map are mainly
        twofold:<br />
        - to allow both long-range and close-range combats to suit different
        guns. This means there should be long lanes that offer great sightlines
        as well as close-range covers.<br />
        - to encourage some strategies such as smoke-and-flank, baiting.
        Additionally, the flag needs to be placed at a obvious but dangerous
        place, effectively making the capturing process more breathtaking.
