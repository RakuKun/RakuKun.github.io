        In this linear narrative level fictionally made for Uncharted 4: A
        Thief's End, I am currently exploring the functions of level in telling
        a traditional three-act story using mainly visual elements.

        <span class="element-title">start</span><br />
        The playable character (in this case, Nathan Drake) is spawned at a
        location relevant to the level destination but away from that. The start
        scene is very often peaceful, as a nice transition from excitement in
        the last scene. In Uncharted 4 many levels are continuously using the
        same maps and goals, where each individual level is designed to control
        the pacing and the delivery of story pieces.
        <br /><span class="element-title">goal</span><br />
        The goal in a linear story telling level is at its core to advance the
        story. Here's a breakdown of the goal and storyline in Uncharted 4.
        <br /><span class="element-title">rules</span><br />
        Very diverse gameplay systems may be used throughout the game, but for
        levels that concentrate on shaping a strong plot, I find more common for
        them to repeatedly use a reliable and simple interaction system than
        consistently introducing new and irrelevant mechanics. Here's a list of
        what Nathan Drake can do in Uncharted 4.
        <br /><span class="element-title">obstacles</span><br />
        What challenges the player from achieving the goal in a linear story
        telling level? My answer is "the level itself". The level itself is
        being integrated into a part of the story and inviting the player to
        indulge themselves in it.

      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">treasures</span><br />
        Treasures invite players to explore the game world more while trying to
        keep the pacing of story intact (they won't dig for 5 minutes for
        something that doesn't help with the story). That being said, most
        treasures as I figured in Uncharted 4 are put in places near, even just
        on main player paths, and getting them doesn't require extra skills:
        follow a YouTube walkthrough and everyone is guaranteed for 100%
        collection rate.<br />
        Most players get "some" treasures under whatever difficulty. But why is
        it so hard for most players to get ALL treasures in their first run? I
        hope this breakdown covers some reasons.

        level design process
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        Based on this level's story-focused nature, I took a different design
        procedure to the
        <a class="link" href="/levels/stealth-level.html">stealth level's. </a>
        <br /><span class="element-title">main player routes</span><br />
        I first fleshed out what routes I suppose most player will choose: in
        general, they are easy to spot and give an illusion that they're the
        fastest and safest way to the destination (of course, things happen).
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/levels/linear-narrative/3d.png" />
        </div>
        <br /><span class="element-title">supporting routes</span><br />
        After I figured the main player routes, I would spend some time
        branching out the newly-made routes for some alternative routes that
        also lead to the destination. This will offer some freedom for players
        and serve as a preparation for connecting the optional (collectible)
        routes to the main routes.
        <br /><span class="element-title">optional routes</span><br />
        The last thing in this process are optional routes by which the player
        can find collectibles in game. They are put not too faraway from the
        main routes but sometimes hidden behind a corner or underwater so
        getting all of them are still a challenging task to do.

      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">using colors</span><br />
        In my level design project colors are simple but playing important roles
        in the whole process. I'd paint everything climbable yellow, while make
        a pure red material for objects that will break from pre-scripted
        events, even if those events are not implemented yet. This helps to keep
        the whole scene neat and easy to understand, and clear to playtesters
        and potential co-workers.
        <br /><span class="element-title">debug camera</span><br />
        I used Blueprint to make a simple free debug camera in play mode, making
        observing the environment in playtest builds much more accessible.
