        Level Design Process
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        Based on this level's story-focused nature, I took a different design
        procedure to the
        <a class="link" href="/levels/stealth-level.html">stealth level's. </a>
        <br /><span class="element-title">main player routes</span><br />
        I first fleshed out what routes I suppose most player will choose: in
        general, they are easy to spot and give an illusion that they're the
        fastest and safest way to the destination (of course, things happen).
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/levels/linear-narrative/3d.png" />
        </div>
        <span class="element-title">supporting/optional routes</span><br />
        After I figured the main player routes, I would spend some time
        branching out the newly-made routes for some alternative routes that
        also lead to the destination. This will offer some freedom for players
        and serve as a preparation for connecting the optional (collectible)
        routes to the main routes.<br /><br />
        The last thing in this process are optional routes by which the player
        can find collectibles in game. They are put not too faraway from the
        main routes but sometimes hidden behind a corner or underwater so
        getting all of them are still a challenging task to do.

        Challenging the Player
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">interaction frequency</span><br />
        As for the basic character-world interactions including jumping,
        climbing and grappling etc., I wanted to be very careful to keep the
        exciting pacing of the adventure while not making the process too
        tedious or repeating. To address the solution, I created a chart where I
        keep recording the numbers of basic interactions (and the difficulty) in
        each smaller areas, and as it transpired, it's a much more lucrative
        approach to manage the pacing than having people running through the
        whole area again and again.
        <br /><span class="element-title">difficulty curve</span><br />
        As explained in the level design analysis, a good level should be having
        smooth but increasing levels of difficulty, and a typical example of
        that will be combat difficulties. There are three major areas that serve
        mainly as combat areas, and I controlled their difficulty curve by
        manipulating area scales, enemies, and covers, three of the most
        important factor that could determine the combat experience. Details are
        in the next section.

        Combat Design
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        This part is dedicated to my thoughts of combat design in a
        linear-narrative level. The section titles actually followed the
        chronicle order of my thought process.
        <br /><span class="element-title">defining goals</span><br />
        I split the goals into three aspects: story-wise, gameplay-wise, and
        emotion-wise. I have prepared a full combat layout document in
        <a
          class="link"

        <br /><span class="element-title">traversing routes</span><br />
        When working on larger combat areas, I would flesh out the character's
        possible traversing routes (even roughly) before getting knee-deep in
        creating specific meshes or putting in enemies.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/levels/linear-narrative/combat-routes.jpg" />
        </div>
        <span class="element-title">stealth and patrolling</span><br />
        The nature of this level raised a challenge for me: to design a combat
        zone that allows both stealth and all-out gunfight experiences, and
        either of them are exciting in its unique way. My approach to this was
        to design enemies' AI for patrolling based on the planned traversing
        routes.
        <br /><span class="element-title">covers</span><br />
        After I got enemies' basics set up, I spend much time iteraing the
        covers that are supposed to enable both combat and stealth. Too many
        covers will make the level not only too easy but scatted, not having a
        focal point; too few covers could possibly ruin the experience and are
        awkward for the artistic feeling as well.

        Level Construction
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">using colors</span><br />
        In my level design project colors are simple but playing important roles
        in the whole process. In the first version, I painted everything
        climbable yellow, while making a pure red material for objects that will
        break from pre-scripted events, even if those events are not implemented
        yet. This helps to keep the whole scene neat and understandable for
        playtesters.<br /><br />
        Digging into this topic further, considering the role a level designer
        plays in the team, coloring things is also a visual communication tool
        betweens disciplines. That's why later I painted the must-go climbing
        steps yellow while making the optional climbables white - once the color
        patterns are established in the process, things would be much easier if
        we want to even excessively iterate them.
        <br /><span class="element-title">debug camera</span><br />
        I used Blueprint to make a simple free-angle debug camera in play mode,
        making observing the environment in playtest builds much more
        accessible. To switch between the player and spectator mode, just press
        'P'.

      <div class="main-design-description">
        Iterations have always been a very important part in my level design
        process. In light of the largeness of this level, I have been inviting
        people to playtest each large area (four in total) once I finished them,
        and absorbed some really good insights of how to polish the user
        experience from both a level designer and producer perspective.
        <span class="element-title">map overview records</span><br />
        Compared to text explanation, a illustrated map that's self-explanatory
        would be more friendly.

        <span class="element-title">combat adjustments</span><br />
        After the second playthrough, I was suggested to further clarify the
        combat layout by providing more details on how the player is supposed to
        react in each area, and how I could design enemies based on that. As a
        consequence, I put more blockings and environmental objects in, in an
        effort to ease out the difficulty curve.

        Level Element Analysis

      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">start</span><br />
        The playable character (in this case, Nathan Drake) is spawned at a
        location relevant to the level destination but away from that. The start
        scene is very often peaceful, as a nice transition from excitement in
        the last scene. In Uncharted 4 many levels are continuously using the
        same maps and goals, where each individual level is designed to control
        the pacing and the delivery of story pieces.
        <br /><span class="element-title">goal</span><br />
        The goal in a linear story telling level is at its core to advance the
        story. Here's a breakdown of the goal and storyline in Uncharted 4.
        <br /><span class="element-title">rules</span><br />
        Very diverse gameplay systems may be used throughout the game, but for
        levels that concentrate on shaping a strong plot, I find more common for
        them to repeatedly use a reliable and simple interaction system than
        consistently introducing new and irrelevant mechanics. Here's a list of
        what Nathan Drake can do in Uncharted 4.
        <br /><span class="element-title">obstacles</span><br />
        What challenges the player from achieving the goal in a linear story
        telling level? My answer is "the level itself". The level itself is
        being integrated into a part of the story and inviting the player to
        indulge themselves in it.
