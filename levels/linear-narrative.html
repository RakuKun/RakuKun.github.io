        This stealth level marks as my first work in Unreal Engine. In this
        project I tried to answer three core questions: What a stealth level
        flow should be like? How to use visual elements to guide the player? How
        to design a level with limited interior space?

      <div class="main-description">
        Stealth game became a serious game genre after Metal Gear Solid came
        out. Its (mostly seen) third person perspective gameplay, combined with
        dramatic plot and the thrilling feeling taking down enemies, fascinates
        players who want something different from a shoot-'em-up.

        element analysis
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        I began the project by analyzing the basic chassis of stealth games.
        Just like other games, some fundamental elements in stealth games should
        be underlined: a start, a goal, game rules, and obstacles.
        <br /><span class="element-title">start</span><br />
        Usually the start point in a stealth level is a relatively safe place
        distant from destination. Being a safe place means players have
        sufficient time to get prepared such as grabbing some equipments and
        inspecting the level for a plan. To make the game more challenging, I
        used the method of backgating: disallowing players to return to the
        spawn place once they left. <br />
        <span class="element-title">goal</span><br />
        The goals in stealth game feels very diverse but are mechanically the
        same: to find some fixed target (treasure, exit, VIP, etc.). Some games
        would ask the players to escape once they finish the first goal, and the
        game pace could change a lot in the escape phase, adding excitement and
        new anxiety to the emotion flow.
        <br />
        <span class="element-title">rules</span><br />
        The principle of designing rules for stealth games is never to make the
        playable character too strong that they can confront a group of armed
        enemies like CoD. As a compensation, the character is offered some
        skills or items to help cope with enemies unnoticed. The enemy AI, which
        is another important factor in game difficulty, needs to be at a fair
        level to make their actions reasonable and acceptable.<br />
        <span class="element-title">obstacles</span><br />
        There are usually a group of enemies on certain patrol routes, trying to
        find and catch the player character. They outnumber the character so it
        is hard once a combat is triggered. For a playable level the enemies'
        action must be predictable so the players can have a strategy and plan
        ahead. On the other hand, players need to use the environment to take
        cover, so many blocking volumes should be in the level too.
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-title">
        <hr />
        pitfalls
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">god path</span><br />
        The god path is a route by which the character have zero chance of being
        noticed. It usually happens when all enemies' patrol routes don't
        overlap with the character's route. This bad design could make the level
        very boring as the players don't need to think, they just go and win.<br /><br />
        Another example of god path is the unfair vantage point, where players
        are allowed to attack enemy from distance while they cannot fight back.
        Again, every game need to balance its challenge and reward. God path
        avoids all challenges, thus causing a broken game setup.<br />
        <span class="element-title">unpredictable AI</span><br />
        Unpredictable AI means pre-scripted enemies don't follow a fixed path,
        or have sudden turn back, or moves too fast. Unpredictable AI makes the
        game hard in an annoying but not challenging way, as the random events
        would kill every plan and mess up the level.<br />
        <span class="element-title">forced gameplay</span><br />
        Many stealth games let playable character have items or weapons. This is
        nice as the players are granted a variety of ways to beat the level. But
        this could also be a pain when some items are designed very specifically
        for one level or even one point in level, and the players cannot beat
        the level if they don't have that. It is always better to provide
        possibility for trying new ways to explore than limiting the gameplay to
        one answer.

        <span class="element-title">Splinter Cell: Blacklist</span><br />
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/levels/stealth-level/blacklist.jpg" />
          <img src="/media/levels/stealth-level/blacklist2.jpg" />
        </div>
        Splinter Cell: Blacklist is the stealth game that I'm mostly getting
        inspired from, and this stealth level project is like the re-creation of
        one of its levels called Private Estate. A scenario set at night,
        Private Estate serves as a great example of the use of light, enemy AI,
        and guiding players in a typical stealth level.
        <br />
        <span class="element-title">MGS V: Phantom Pain</span>
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/levels/stealth-level/mgsv.jpg" />
        </div>
        Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain is a critically claimed stealth title
        from one of my favorite game director, Hideo Kojima. I especially like
        its day-night system, which adds another layer of fun and strategy to
        the same map. Again, MGSV teaches a good lesson on how crucial lighting
        in dark scenes.
        <br />
        <span class="element-title">Uncharted 4</span>
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/levels/stealth-level/uncharted4.jpg" />
        </div>
        Although Uncharted 4 is not a stealth game, some of its levels cleverly
        add stealth element to make the game feel diverse and interesting.
        What's more, the way it tells a continuous story using level design is a
        great source for learning. The picture above comes from "get out of the
        orphanage" scenario in chapter 1, which shows the players a segment of
        Nathan Drake's childhood.<br /><br />
        This level did another point extremely well: making wait time
        interesting. As usually seen in stealth levels, at some points players
        have to wait till enemies pass by or turn around, and the process can be
        tedious. Uncharted 4, however, makes NPCs talk and do things all the
        time, so that players can stay at a high interest level and get useful
        information to push the story. It's indeed a clever trick.

      <div class="main-design-description">
        Prior to grayboxing, I used Adobe Illustrator to lay out the map in 2d.
        Some of the more important things I wanted to clarify in 2d map are:<br />
        - determining the critical path;
        <br />- double-confirming the goal of the level;<br />
        - assuring that the level is well paced.

        <span class="element-title">macro -> micro</span><br />
        I like to ponder the design from a macro perspective first, then zoom in
        on the details. For this project, the game pace is the first thing
        confirmed. When I was drawing the 2d map, I always design the large part
        first (exterior & interior), then split each part into smaller pieces
        (garage/living room/bedroom), then decide where to put the lighting,
        then consider level dressing such as furniture.

        3d modelling
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        Putting 2D maps into a 3D world is not simply replacing lines with
        cubes. I need to think how to translate the design faithfully and
        efficiently:<br />
        -Pay special attention to the height difference. Height difference would
        matter a lot in determining the visibility, and engaging enemies from a
        higher place is possible but is almost impossible from a lower place.<br />
        -Lines in 3D world have height and thickness. Wall is a key component in
        3D stealth games as it blocks the sight and gives space for players to
        hide and ambush.<br />

        level design
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">patrol patterns</span><br />
        I've concluded three types of possible enemy patrol patterns, and
        analyzed how to implement them in levels.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/levels/stealth-level/patrol-patterns.png" />
        </div>
        <span class="element-title">mesh & color</span><br />
        Although the purpose of this level is not to make an environment design
        portfolio, I built the level in medium detail, especially in places that
        should attract more attention. <br /><br />
        What is interesting is that, when I was blocking out the level and
        testing, I found in real practices, each floor in interior levels should
        better be HIGHER than in real life, due to fact that the position of
        third-person camera is usually higher than the player character, which
        makes the surroundings look lower.<br /><br />
        I paid special attention to the colors being used on meshes. For a level
        design project, I guess the prior job for color is not really to make a
        level "real", but to make it MEANINGFUL. Every color should tell the
        player clearly its purpose: maybe it's to attract attention as a focal
        point; maybe it's to indicate of a place where special item hides; maybe
        to convey faithfully a mood of the scene.<br /><br />
        Translucent material is another component I played with this time. I
        used it on pieces of mansion window glass to make the mansion feel
        artistically modern and alive, but also to help players see through some
        part of the mansion and guide them. An example is the glass in front of
        stairs so players can see that the first moment they enter the
        mansion.<br />
        <span class="element-title">lighting</span><br />
        Lights plays a significant role in scenes at night. In my level lighting
        was used mostly to indicate important locations and hence direct the
        players. Lights can also affect the mood of a place: less lighting
        suggests a potentially dangerous place while bright lighting invigorate
        people to explore.
        <br /><span class="element-title">collectibles</span><br />
        One of my principles of using collectibles is that I didn't use them to
        attract players, but to reward those who have curiosity and patience to
        explore every corner of the world. So they serve as a result of
        exploration.

      <div class="main-design-description">
        I used Blueprint to do all game logic, and it's also a point where I can

        </div>
        <span class="element-title">enemy AI</span><br />
        To create a highly customizable and robust AI system, I used a
        combination of Unreal Engine's AI perception system, behavior tree, and
        various Blueprints. Also to increase the visibility of AI sight, I used
        enemies' flashlights to indicate their sight range, which proved to be
        working well in playtests.
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/levels/stealth-level/ai-1.png" />
          <img src="/media/levels/stealth-level/ai-2.png" />
        </div>
        I think in a dynamic point of view. Enemies have vision cones and as
        they move, they are observing different places. As I programmed the
        whole game system, there are way more details that needs careful
        thoughts.
        <br /><span class="element-title">interactive system</span><br />
        Having a consistent input system for interaction is essential in
        eliminating confusions. Players are given the capability of interacting
        with various objects including enemies, doors, collectibles and intels,
        for which only two keys (interact, attack) will be required.
        <br /><span class="element-title">dialogue system</span><br />
        Dialogue system in this game also plays as a guide that reminds the
        player of where they are and what they should be doing.

        playtesting

      <div class="main-design-description">
        I consider playtesting a crucial part of level design, especially when I
        realized the magic it plays to bring a 6/10 level to 8 points. (or
        higher!)
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/levels/stealth-level/iteration-1.png" />
        </div>
        The first feedback from a professional includes making better use of the
        vantage point and adding more guide along the level so the player can
        keep track of where they are and where is the destination. I also
        noticed that enemy patrol routes are so easy that there's actually "god
        path" which is mentioned earlier as a pitfall in stealth levels. To
        solve the problem, I re-designed enemies' patrol routes and also created
        more obstacles.

        what went well
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        For the three core questions raised at the beginning of the process, I
        think I did first two of them well, while still have much to learn.
        <br /><span class="element-title">level flow</span><br />
        Rome is not built in a day.
        <br /><span class="element-title">atmosphere</span><br />
        Almost every playtesters mentioned the intense atmosphere when playing,
        which quite fits my expectation.
        <br /><span class="element-title">using the engine</span><br />
        Prior to the project (which is my first official UE project), I spent
        about two weeks learning some basic stuff about Unreal Engine, all of
        which eventually proved useful. The best part of all these systems is
        their compatibility - Unreal Engine makes it easy to transplant the
        systems to another game that needs them.
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-title">

        what didn't go well
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">interior design</span><br />
        Admittedly, designing indoor level almost took me twice the time of
        outdoor part. I realized the composition became really different when I
        wanted the guide the players in a narrow area. And setting obstacles was
        also more difficult when designing the inside part.
        <br /><span class="element-title">details</span><br />
        Yes, I talked to myself and found that compared to enhancing the
        details, I was more willing to think about the macro - feeling, level
        flow, constructing logic... The level was definitely not perfect as I
        sensed many details are still missing - and some of them might have been
        a good guide or challenge.
