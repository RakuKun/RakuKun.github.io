        This stealth level marks my first work in Unreal Engine 4. In this
        project I tried to answer three core questions: What a stealth level
        flow should be like? How to use visual elements to guide the player? How
        to design a level with limited interior space?<br /><br />

      <div class="main-title">Stealth Game Design</div>
      <div class="main-description">
        Stealth games have become a serious game genre since the Metal Gear
        Solid series came out. The (most commonly) third-person perspective
        gameplay, combined with the thrilling feeling of puzzle solving and
        storytelling, fascinates players who want something different from a
        shoot-'em-up. In this section I'll summarize some general points to make
        a stealth level good.
        <br />
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-title">
        <hr />
        element analysis
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        To me a "game" is consisted of four core elements, and this level I
        built is no exception.
        <br /><span class="element-title">start</span><br />
        Usually the start point in a stealth level is a safe area distant from
        destination. Starting there means that players have sufficient time to
        get prepared, i.e. grabbing some equipments and inspecting the level
        layout for a plan. <br />
        <span style="font-style: italic"
          >To make my level more challenging, I used the method of blocking:
          disallowing players to return to the same place they just left. <br
        /></span>
        <span class="element-title">goal</span><br />
        The goals in a typical stealth game can vary a lot but are mechanically
        the same: to find some fixed targets (treasure, exit, VIP, etc.). Some
        games ask the players to escape once they finish the first goal, and the
        game pace could change a lot in the escape phase, adding excitement and
        new anxiety to the emotion flow.<br />
        <span style="font-style: italic"
          >The goals in my level are "to find something" but feel different as I
          changed the pace and emotion flow through the level construction. <br
        /></span>
        <span class="element-title">rules</span><br />
        The principal rule for stealth games is never to make the playable
        character too strong to a point where they can confront a group of armed
        enemies like CoD. The game is "stealth" when most progress can be done
        without alarming too many enemies. As a compensation, the character can
        be offered some skills or items to help navigate or deal with enemies
        safely. The enemy AI, another important factor in control of the game
        difficulty, needs to be at a reasonable, and acceptable level.<br />
        <span style="font-style: italic"
          >In my level I didn't allow the character to kill people, to make my
          level flow under control and traditional. <br
        /></span>
        <span class="element-title">obstacles</span><br />
        Obstacles can be anything that stand in the way of the process. There
        are a group of enemies with certain patrol routes, trying to find and
        catch the playable character. They outnumber the character, so the
        player won't want to ignite a all-out gunfight. Also for the
        playability, enemies' actions should be predictable for the player side
        to plan out a strategy in advance. On the other hand, players need to
        use the environment for cover, so many blocking volumes should be in the
        level too.
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-title">
        <hr />
        pitfalls
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">god path</span><br />
        A god path is a route by which the playable character has zero chance of
        being noticed. A typical god path is formed when all enemies' patrol
        routes don't overlap with each other, or don't cover a bit of the
        necessary player route. This bad design could make the level very boring
        as the players can proceed and win without even trying.<br /><br />
        Another example of god path is the unfair vantage point, where the
        character is allowed to shoot enemies down from distance while they
        cannot fight back. Again, every game need to balance its challenge and
        reward. God path avoids all challenges, thus causing a broken game
        setup.<br />
        <span class="element-title">unpredictable AI</span><br />
        Unpredictable AI means pre-scripted enemies don't follow a fixed path,
        or have sudden turn back, or moves too fast. Unpredictable AI makes the
        game hard in an annoying way as the random events would kill every plan
        and mess up the level. It's the opposite of god path, making the game
        too hard for players.<br />
        <span class="element-title">forced gameplay</span><br />
        Many stealth games allow the character to choose preferred equipments.
        This is nice as the players are granted a variety of ways to beat the
        level. But this could also be a pain when some items are designed very
        specifically for a level or even a point in the level, which the players
        have to use to proceed. It's fine to introduce some mechanics within a
        tutorial level, but designers should provide the opportunity to explore
        new ways rather than to limit the gameplay to one answer.

        <span class="element-title">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist</span
        ><br />
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/levels/stealth-level/blacklist.jpg" />
          <img src="/media/levels/stealth-level/blacklist2.jpg" />
        </div>
        Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist is the game that I'm mostly
        getting inspired from when doing this project. Among its many levels,
        the Private Estate level serves as a great example of the use of light,
        and visual guiding in a scenario set at night. Also this level
        introduces multiple goals step by step that help push the story.
        <br />
        <span class="element-title">Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</span>
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/levels/stealth-level/mgsv.jpg" />
        </div>
        Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a critically claimed stealth
        title from one of my favorite game directors, Hideo Kojima-san. I
        especially like its day-night system, which adds another layer of fun
        and strategy to the same map. In addition, MGSV also teaches a good
        lesson on the use of light as a visual aid in night scenes, as shown in
        the picture above.
        <br />
        <span class="element-title">Uncharted 4: A Thief's End</span>
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/levels/stealth-level/uncharted4.jpg" />
        </div>
        Although Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is not a game built around its
        stealth system, some of its levels cleverly added stealth element to
        change the pacing and interest curve. What's more, the way in which it
        told a complete story using levels is a great learning resource. The
        picture above came from "get out of the orphanage" scenario in chapter
        1, where the game showed a fragment of Nathan Drake's childhood as a
        reflection of his forming personality.<br /><br />
        This level did another point extremely well:
        <span style="font-style: italic"
          >making the wait time interesting.</span
        >
        As usually seen in stealth levels, at some points players have to wait
        till enemies pass by or turn around and the waiting process can be
        tedious. Uncharted 4, however, makes NPCs talk and do things all the
        time, so that while players wait, they still stay at a high interest
        level and get useful information to understand the story.

        2d layout
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        Prior to greyboxing, I used Adobe Illustrator to lay out the map in 2d.
        Some of the more important things I wanted to clarify in 2d map were:<br />
        - to determine the general player path;<br />
        - to double-confirm the goal of the level;<br />
        - to provide metrics for 3d meshes.

        methodology
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">macro -> micro</span><br />
        I like to ponder the design from a macro perspective first, then zoom in
        on the details. For this project, the game pace is the first thing
        confirmed. When I was drawing the 2d map, I always design the large part
        first (exterior & interior), then split each part into smaller pieces
        (garage/living room/bedroom), then decide where to put the lighting,
        then consider level dressing such as furniture.
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-title">
        <hr />
        3d modelling
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        Putting 2D maps into a 3D world is not simply replacing lines with
        cubes. I need to think how to translate the design faithfully and
        efficiently:<br />
        -Pay special attention to the height difference. Height difference would
        matter a lot in determining the visibility, and engaging enemies from a
        higher place is possible but is almost impossible from a lower place.<br />
        -Lines in 3D world have height and thickness. Wall is a key component in
        3D stealth games as it blocks the sight and gives space for players to
        hide and ambush.<br />

        level design
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">patrol patterns</span><br />
        I've concluded three types of possible enemy patrol patterns, and
        analyzed how to implement them in levels.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/levels/stealth-level/patrol-patterns.png" />
        </div>
        <span class="element-title">mesh & color</span><br />
        Although the purpose of this level is not to make an environment design
        portfolio, I built the level in medium detail, especially in places that
        should attract more attention. <br /><br />
        What is interesting is that, when I was blocking out the level and
        testing, I found in real practices, each floor in interior levels should
        better be HIGHER than in real life, due to fact that the position of
        third-person camera is usually higher than the player character, which
        makes the surroundings look lower.<br /><br />
        I paid special attention to the colors being used on meshes. For a level
        design project, I guess the prior job for color is not really to make a
        level "real", but to make it MEANINGFUL. Every color should tell the
        player clearly its purpose: maybe it's to attract attention as a focal
        point; maybe it's to indicate of a place where special item hides; maybe
        to convey faithfully a mood of the scene.<br /><br />
        Translucent material is another component I played with this time. I
        used it on pieces of mansion window glass to make the mansion feel
        artistically modern and alive, but also to help players see through some
        part of the mansion and guide them. An example is the glass in front of
        stairs so players can see that the first moment they enter the
        mansion.<br />
        <span class="element-title">lighting</span><br />
        Lights plays a significant role in scenes at night. In my level lighting
        was used mostly to indicate important locations and hence direct the
        players. Lights can also affect the mood of a place: less lighting
        suggests a potentially dangerous place while bright lighting invigorate
        people to explore.
        <br /><span class="element-title">collectibles</span><br />
        One of my principles of using collectibles is that I didn't use them to
        attract players, but to reward those who have curiosity and patience to
        explore every corner of the world. So they serve as a result of
        exploration.

        level construction
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        I used Blueprint to do all game logic, and it's also a point where I can
        watch how level runs and adjust parameters accordingly.
        <br /><span class="element-title">patrol system</span><br />
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/levels/stealth-level/patrol-1.png" />
          <img src="/media/levels/stealth-level/patrol-2.png" />
        </div>
        <span class="element-title">enemy AI</span><br />
        To create a highly customizable and robust AI system, I used a
        combination of Unreal Engine's AI perception system, behavior tree, and
        various Blueprints. Also to increase the visibility of AI sight, I used
        enemies' flashlights to indicate their sight range, which proved to be
        working well in playtests.
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/levels/stealth-level/ai-1.png" />
          <img src="/media/levels/stealth-level/ai-2.png" />
        </div>
        I think in a dynamic point of view. Enemies have vision cones and as
        they move, they are observing different places. As I programmed the
        whole game system, there are way more details that needs careful
        thoughts.
        <br /><span class="element-title">interactive system</span><br />
        Having a consistent input system for interaction is essential in
        eliminating confusions. Players are given the capability of interacting
        with various objects including enemies, doors, collectibles and intels,
        for which only two keys (interact, attack) will be required.
        <br /><span class="element-title">dialogue system</span><br />
        Dialogue system in this game also plays as a guide that reminds the
        player of where they are and what they should be doing.
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-title">

        playtesting
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        I consider playtesting a crucial part of level design, especially when I
        realized the magic it plays to bring a 6/10 level to 8 points. (or
        higher!)
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/levels/stealth-level/iteration-1.png" />
        </div>
        The first feedback from a professional includes making better use of the
        vantage point and adding more guide along the level so the player can
        keep track of where they are and where is the destination. I also
        noticed that enemy patrol routes are so easy that there's actually "god
        path" which is mentioned earlier as a pitfall in stealth levels. To
        solve the problem, I re-designed enemies' patrol routes and also created
        more obstacles.

        which quite fits my expectation.
        <br /><span class="element-title">using the engine</span><br />
        Prior to the project (which is my first official UE project), I spent
        about two weeks learning some basic stuff about Unreal Engine, all of
        which eventually proved useful. The best part of all these systems is
        their compatibility - Unreal Engine makes it easy to transplant the
        systems to another game that needs them.

        <span class="element-title">interior design</span><br />
        Admittedly, designing indoor level almost took me twice the time of
        outdoor part. I realized the composition became really different when I
        wanted the guide the players in a narrow area. And setting obstacles was
        also more difficult when designing the inside part.
        <br /><span class="element-title">details</span><br />
        Yes, I talked to myself and found that compared to enhancing the
        details, I was more willing to think about the macro - feeling, level
        flow, constructing logic... The level was definitely not perfect as I
        sensed many details are still missing - and some of them might have been
        a good guide or challenge.
