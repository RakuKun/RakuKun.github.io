      <div class="main-description">
        Stadia is a cloud gaming service operated by Google, advertised to be
        capable of streaming high-quality video games to players via the
        company's numerous data centers across the globe. The service is
        accessible through most smart ends like cell phones and PC, provided the
        users are using a sufficiently high-speed Internet connection.<br /><br />
        In March 2019, Stadia announced a platform exclusive feature called
        State Share, which leverages cloud game hosting to enable players to
        share a complete game state (not just a specified save state) instantly
        to others. The goal for project Ditto is to explore the possibility of
        this feature specifically for the discovery of new kinds of game design
        patterns and new game genres that are inherently viral and require to
        elaborate player cooperation across massive scale audience.

        Pre-production
      </div>
      <div class="main-description">
        Pre-production witnessed our first two months during which we spent
        about three weeks doing initial research and pitching ideas in the
        ideation phase, and the rest five weeks developing paper and digital
        prototypes.
      </div>

        researching
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">clarifying path</span><br />
        As State Share is a relatively new technology with little reference and
        tech demo publicly published, we started off by thinking the special
        points of State Share and how it enables the potential the game
        design.<br /><br />
        After reading the post on Stadia's
        <span class="important">
          <a
            onclick="transitionToPage('https:/stadia.dev/intl/en_us/blog/','var(--shironeri)')"
            >developer website
          </a>
        </span>
        ,we concluded some of its merits:<br />
        1. State Share integrates well with Youtube streaming as it allows
        viewers to jump into the same game as the streamers easily. This
        broadens the way streamer and viewer can interact. <br />
        2. State Share create the link along with last 30 seconds' gameplay, and
        all information during that time will be included. The developers have
        much freedom to decide which and how the information is to be used.<br />
        3. State Share works with other Stadia features such as Crowd Play, and
        Stadia team is working to bring more flexibility to its function.<br /><br />
        What's more, during discussions with our client, Erin Hoffman-John, we
        were assured that for most tech issues we could "fake" State Share in
        Unity without really implementing the Stadia SDK. In that sense, we as
        developers could concentrate on
        <span class="bold"
          >creating a game mechanism that centers State Share as core
          gameplay.</span
        >
        <br /><span class="element-title">ideation</span><br />
        After internal and client meetings we concluded ten possible ways of
        implementing State Share, with a total over 30 different ideas.
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/games/ditto/ideas-1.jpg" />
          <img src="/media/games/ditto/ideas-2.jpg" />
        </div>
        We realized that we had too many ideas all of which seemed plausible.
        Our next move was to narrow down ideas into several representative ones
        each catagories its type. This time we got five ideas with more concrete
        gameplay, ready for prototyping.
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-title">

        prototyping
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">paper prototype</span><br />
        We each created one paper prototype from the five ideas as designing on
        paper could expose the core mechanics well. The one I designed, "Bomb
        Express" explores the concept "delivering the state".
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/games/ditto/paper-1.jpg" />
          <img src="/media/games/ditto/bomb-express.png" />
        </div>
        We realized that State Share serves better as an
        <span class="bold">"amplifier"</span> for the existing experience, while
        it does offer new possibilities for multiplayer mechanics. <br /><span
          class="element-title"
          >playtests</span
        ><br />
        It is also very important to run playtests as many as possible. For
        paper prototypes we have run 3 rounds of playtests, the first and second
        being internal testing, and the third time we invited some EA
        individuals whose experience is very valuable to improve our design.
        Here are some suggestions from the playtesters: <br />
        1. Think of State Share as a core feature without which the gameplay
        would change a lot. <br />
        2. Be careful about the theme: is the fiction suitable for all ages?
        Will the game mechanism ask for some private information such as living
        location? <br />
        3. Some of our paper prototypes have issues on replayability as they are
        puzzle driven. This can be difficult as State Share is designed for a
        relatively large number of people so spoilers may have an impact on the
        game.<br />
        4. Online multiplayer games are challenging but seems more promising,
        while unsynchronized gameplay is easier to do digital prototypes.
        <br /><span class="element-title">learnings</span><br />
        From feedbacks, follow-up discussions and client meetings, we have drawn
        up three design criteria:<br />
        - Asymmetrical gameplay is suitable for streamer and audience and well
        conveys State Share’s idea.<br />
        - Having a persistent world (like MMO games) is state sharable and could
        let players feel more immersed.<br />
        - To make a multiplicative distribution rather than transferring a
        single branch to new players.<br /><br />
        Now that we were pretty clear about how to keep moving forward, we
        stepped into the digital prototyping phase.
        <br /><span class="element-title">digital prototype</span><br />
        We built a digital prototype for the Virus vs. Cell theme which utilized
        State Share well as the core mechanism - without State Share the game
        will be unplayable. <br /><br />
        My major job was designing and modelling levels for the prototype. I
        spent some time researching levels in LocoRoco for inspiration.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/games/ditto/pvp-level-1.png" />
        </div>
        <span class="element-title">moving forward</span><br />
        While developing the digital prototype, we came up with another paper
        prototype: growing a treehouse. After discussing with our client, we
        realized that we are in fact building two types of games, the first one
        being skill-based game (Virus vs. Cells), and the second one being
        expressive game (treehouse). Having no more than eight weeks for
        developing a high fidelity prototype, we wanted to move forward with the
        Virus vs. Cell one since we believed it had a more feasible scope. This
        did not mean the time spent on treehouse prototype was meaningless: we
        recorded it in the design documentation in case anyone is interested in
        the future.

      <div class="main-title">Production and Pivoting</div>
      <div class="main-description">
        The second half of the semester was pretty dramatic: we experienced some
        setback adjusting the project to work-from-home style, but were also
        granted a chance to pivot the game's theme and gameplay. The final
        product is called: Immunoo!
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-title">
        <hr />
        Changing to PVE
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        We experienced a pivoting in the foci of project soon after the second
        half of the semester began. From then on, the game would focus on its
        PVE content rather than PVP, asking designers to come up with new ways
        to let players call their friends to join the game. The original theme,
        Virus vs. Cell remained intact, but we did want the players to play as
        the guarding cells in the human body to experience the excitement and
        sense of achievement while fighting the evil, chaotic viruses.<br /><br />
        During internal meetings, we realized the limitation in time and decided
        that we should start from a single scene, a single type of player, and a
        single type of enemy: the player will act as white blood cell trying to
        wipe out viruses inside a man's heart, the feeling of gameplay should be
        cute and dangerous.<br /><br />
        As the game and level designer on the team, after determining several
        environmental effects in the level, I started working on the level
        layout.
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-title">
        <hr />
        Level Design
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">level mechanics</span><br />
        Since the game happens inside the heart, we wanted to use some unique
        environmental mechanics to propel the players into challenges. Then the
        rhythm bloodstream came to mind: both the virus and the white blood cell
        will move with the blood stream. However, the virus will be largely
        influenced by the blood flow, while the white blood cell will have some
        control over its movement. This could make the "chase" part fun and
        strategic, and made controlling the level flow easier.<br /><br />
        The game should still highlight the interaction between players because
        they now can see each other in the game, and fit the spirit of State
        Share.
        <br /><span class="element-title">level layout</span><br />
        Inspired by our client’s suggestion, we use a method called IPM
        (Introduce, Practice, Master) as a principle in designing the levels.
        All chambers are designed for multiplayer experience, with increasing
        demands for skill mastery from players. The increasing difficulty mainly
        means more enemies and more complex mechanics in the later chambers. The
        following shows the final level layout:
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/games/ditto/chamber-1.png" />
          <img src="/media/games/ditto/chamber-2.png" />
        </div>
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/games/ditto/chamber-3.png" />
          <img src="/media/games/ditto/chamber-4.png" />
        </div>
        The last chamber was designed to be the boss fight room, with a
        preparation room in front of it which technically serves as a place for
        players to invite their friends/audience and team up before entering the
        boss room.<br /><br />

        The boss fight’s mechanics are partly different from previous experience
        because we wanted to make it feel more intense and highlight the
        connection between each player and the necessity of sharing and helping
        others. The powerful mother virus is in invulnerable at the beginning,
        players will have to eat all the surrounding child viruses in order to
        make it vulnerable and surround it again to disintegrate and “kill” it.

        As the 3D artist, I was responsible for creating all 3D assets for the

        as the process always inspires me to be a better game designer.
        <br /><br />
        The project was not flawless, of course. We could have done more if the
        schedule was not interrupted by the outbreak, and we lost some
        productivity due to work-from-home. Many features we designed were still
        on the paper because we didn't have time to implement them.
