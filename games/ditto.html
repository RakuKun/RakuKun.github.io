      <div class="main-description" style="width: 100%;">
        In March 2019 Google Stadia announced a platform exclusive feature
        called State Share. This technology leverages cloud game hosting to
        enable players to share a complete game state (not just a specified save
        state) instantly to their friends or to the public. The project explores
        the possibility of this technology specifically for the discovery of new
        kinds of game design patterns and new game genres that are inherently
        viral and require elaborate player cooperation across massive scale
        audiences.

      <div class="main-title">

      </div>
      <div class="main-description">
        We spent about three weeks doing research and thinking of new ideas. As
        State Share is a relatively new function exclusively developed for
        Stadia with little reference or tech demo so far, we start off thinking
        the special points of State Share and how can it contribute to the game
        design and streaming community.

        After reading the posts on the
        <span class="important">
          <a
            onclick="transitionToPage('https:/stadia.dev/intl/en_us/blog/','var(--shironeri)')"
            >developer website,
          </a>
        </span>
        we concluded some merits that differentiate State Share with massive
        online multiplayer or local multiplayer feature.<br />
        1. State Share works well with Youtube streaming as it posts a link in
        the chat and audience can jump into the game simply by clicking the
        link. This enables new ways for streamers to interact with their
        audience. <br />
        2. State Share will record last 30s video before creating the link, and
        all information during that time will be included in the link. The
        developers have much freedom to decide which and how the information is
        to be used.<br />
        3. State Share will work with other Stadia features such as Crowd Play
        and Stadia Team is working to bring more flexibility to its function. In
        that sense, we as developers would concentrate on finding a well
        structured gameplay that manipulates State Share as its core mechanics.
        <br /><span class="element-title">possible usage</span><br />
        After internal and client meetings we concluded 10 possible ways to use
        State Share.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/games/stadia/stadia-1.jpg" />
        </div>
      </div>

        <hr />
        prototyping
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">specification</span><br />
        Starting from week 3, we decided to narrow down ideas by eliminating
        those unpractical or not using State Share as a important mechanism. And
        this time we got 5 more concrete ideas that are ready for
        prototyping.<br />
        <span class="element-title">paper prototype</span><br />
        We use paper prototypes for the 5 ideas as designing on paper is easier
        technically and could expose the core mechanics well. The one I designed
        explores the concept of "delivering the state".
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/games/stadia/stadia-2.jpg" />
          <img src="/media/games/stadia/stadia-3.jpg" />
        </div>
        It is also very important to run playtests as many as possible. For
        paper prototypes we have run 3 rounds of playtests, the first and second
        being internal testing, and the third time we invited some EA
        individuals whose experience is very valuable to improve our design.
        Here are some suggestions from the playtesters: <br />
        1. Think of State Share as a core feature without which the gameplay
        would change a lot. <br />
        2. Be careful about the theme: is the fiction suitable for all ages?
        Will the game mechanism ask for some private information such as living
        location? <br />
        3. Some of our paper prototypes have issues on replayability as they are
        puzzle driven. This can be difficult as State Share is designed for a
        relatively large number of people so spoilers may have an impact on the
        game.<br />
        4. Online multiplayer games are challenging but seems more promising,
        while unsynchronized gameplay is easier to do digital prototypes.<br />
        Now since we have done the quarter walkaround, we are stepping into the
        digital prototyping phase.<br />
        <span class="element-title">learnings</span><br />
        There are three criteria that could boost state sharing:<br />
        Asymmetrical gameplay is suitable for streamer and audience and well
        conveys State Share’s idea.<br />
        Having a persistent world (like mmo) is state sharable and could let
        players feel more immersed.<br />
        To make multiplicative distribution rather than transferring a single
        branch to new players.<br />
        <span class="element-title">digital prototype</span><br />
        Starting week 5 (March 9) the team will be working on making two digital
        prototypes till week 8. The first and the one we put major work on is
        Virus vs. Cells theme which utilizes State Share as the core mechanism:
        without State Share the game will be unplayable. The second one uses
        State Share as a way solely for exchanging information and game
        progress, so the mechanism could be more conservative. The main purpose
        for doing two is that we try to explore further in two directions of
        which we don't know for sure what will be the hit.<br />
        My major job is designing levels for the Virus one and program for the
        second one.

      <div class="main-description">
        The production phase is set to start after Week 8 (the halves
        presentation). We will begin the production work once we settle down on
        a concept that we all are interested and confident to build.
