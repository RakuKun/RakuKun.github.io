      <div class="main-description">
        Stadia is a cloud gaming service operated by Google, advertised to be
        capable of streaming video games up to 4K/60FPS to players via the
        company's numerous data centers across the globe. The service is
        accessible through most smart ends including iOS, Android, PC, provided
        the users are using a sufficiently high-speed Internet connection.<br /><br />
        In March 2019 Stadia announced a platform exclusive feature called State
        Share, which leverages cloud game hosting to enable players to share a
        complete game state (not just a specified save state) instantly to
        others. The project explores the possibility of this feature
        specifically for the discovery of new kinds of game design patterns and
        new game genres that are inherently viral and require to elaborate
        player cooperation across massive scale audiences.

        Pre-production

      <div class="main-description">
        Pre-production witnesses our first two months during which we spent
        about three weeks doing initial research and pitching ideas during the
        ideation phase, and we used the rest five weeks developing paper and
        digital prototypes.
      </div>

        researching

      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">clarifying path</span><br />
        As State Share is a relatively new technology with little reference and
        tech demo publicly published, we started off by thinking the special
        points of State Share and how it enables the potential the game
        design.<br /><br />
        After reading the post on Stadia's
        <span class="important">
          <a
            onclick="transitionToPage('https:/stadia.dev/intl/en_us/blog/','var(--shironeri)')"
            >developer website
          </a>
        </span>
        ,we concluded some of its merits:<br />
        1. State Share integrates well with Youtube streaming as it allows
        viewers to jump into the same game as the streamers easily. This
        broadens the way streamer and viewer can interact. <br />
        2. State Share create the link along with last 30 seconds' gameplay, and
        all information during that time will be included. The developers have
        much freedom to decide which and how the information is to be used.<br />
        3. State Share works with other Stadia features such as Crowd Play, and
        Stadia team is working to bring more flexibility to its function.<br /><br />
        What's more, during discussions with our client, Erin Hoffman-John, we
        were assured that for most tech issues we could "fake" State Share in
        Unity without really implementing the Stadia SDK. In that sense, we as
        developers could concentrate on
        <span class="bold"
          >creating a game mechanism that centers State Share as core
          gameplay.</span
        >
        <br /><span class="element-title">ideation</span><br />
        After internal and client meetings we concluded ten possible ways of
        implementing State Share, with a total over 30 different ideas.
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/games/ditto/ideas-1.jpg" />
          <img src="/media/games/ditto/ideas-2.jpg" />
        </div>
        We realized that we had too many ideas all of which seemed plausible.
        Our next move was to narrow down ideas into several representative ones
        each catagories its type. This time we got five ideas with more concrete
        gameplay, ready for prototyping.

        prototyping
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">paper prototype</span><br />
        We each created one paper prototype for the five ideas as designing on
        paper is technically easier and could expose the core mechanics well.
        The one I designed, "Bomb Express" explores the concept "delivering the
        state".
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/games/ditto/paper-1.jpg" />
          <img src="/media/games/ditto/bomb-express.png" />
        </div>
        We realized that State Share serves better as an
        <span class="bold">"amplifier"</span> for the existing experience, while
        it does offer new possibilities for multiplayer mechanics. <br /><span
          class="element-title"
          >playtests</span
        ><br />
        It is also very important to run playtests as many as possible. For
        paper prototypes we have run 3 rounds of playtests, the first and second
        being internal testing, and the third time we invited some EA
        individuals whose experience is very valuable to improve our design.
        Here are some suggestions from the playtesters: <br />
        1. Think of State Share as a core feature without which the gameplay
        would change a lot. <br />
        2. Be careful about the theme: is the fiction suitable for all ages?
        Will the game mechanism ask for some private information such as living
        location? <br />
        3. Some of our paper prototypes have issues on replayability as they are
        puzzle driven. This can be difficult as State Share is designed for a
        relatively large number of people so spoilers may have an impact on the
        game.<br />
        4. Online multiplayer games are challenging but seems more promising,
        while unsynchronized gameplay is easier to do digital prototypes.
        <br /><span class="element-title">learnings</span><br />
        From feedbacks, follow-up discussions and client meetings, we have drawn
        up three design criteria:<br />
        - Asymmetrical gameplay is suitable for streamer and audience and well
        conveys State Share’s idea.<br />
        - Having a persistent world (like mmo) is state sharable and could let
        players feel more immersed.<br />
        - To make a multiplicative distribution rather than transferring a
        single branch to new players.<br /><br />
        Now that we were pretty clear about how to keep moving forward, we
        stepped into the digital prototyping phase.
        <br /><span class="element-title">digital prototype</span><br />
        Starting week 5 (March 9) the team will be working on making two digital
        prototypes till week 8. The first and the one we put major work on is
        Virus vs. Cells theme which utilizes State Share as the core mechanism:
        without State Share the game will be unplayable. The second one uses
        State Share as a way solely for exchanging information and game
        progress, so the mechanism could be more conservative. The main purpose
        for doing two is that we try to explore further in two directions of
        which we don't know for sure what will be the hit.<br />
        My major job is designing levels for the Virus one and helping with the
        second one's design.
        <br /><span class="element-title">moving forward</span><br />
        After the discussion with out client, we realized that we are in fact
        building two types of games, the first one being skill-based game (Virus
        vs. Cells), and the second one being expressive game (treehouse). Given
        no more than eight weeks in the second half of semester, we

        The production phase is set to start after Week 8 (the halves
        presentation). We will begin the production work once we settle down on
