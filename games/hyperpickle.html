      <div class="top-introduction">
        HyperPickle is a client project built for picoCTF 2021, a two-week
        online cybersecurity competition. The team is building a game that's
        oriented around delivering a fun, engaging experience to attract people
        to join the competition. The game features the ability to exchange
        resources and make friends with aliens while exploring the interesting,
        diverse cosmos.

      <div class="main-description">
        This game is designed primarily for middle school and high school
        students with little to intermediate knowledge in cybersecurity area.
        The lack of knowledge required necessarily to answer picoCTF questions
        used to be a major setback when progressing the game that was dependent
        on such questions.<br /><br />
        To address the solution, I present HyperPickle, a game that's oriented
        around levels of progression, unique achievements and a space theme to
        engage and encourage the contestants to answer questions with a high
        entertainment value.

      <div class="main-title">Background</div>
      <div class="main-description">
        PicoCTF is a annual two-week cybersecurity online competition held by
        the CMU CyLab. The competition has been popular among middle school to
        college students across the globe, and the collaboration between the ETC
        and CyLab has been successfully running for years with a game built each
        year for the competition. Again, the same goal was assigned to our team,
        but the difference is that we managed to dig further into client's
        requirements.

      <div class="main-title">Pre-production</div>
      <div class="main-description">
        The team has spent the first four weeks in the semester understanding
        the project and getting prepared for full-production.

        <span class="element-title">understanding the goal</span><br />
        The salient point of working on a delivery project is to know the target
        audience and understand the client’s requirements, so as to set goals
        accordingly. During the communication, we got to know that the majority
        of contestants who try the game will be middle to high school students
        with little to intermediate cybersecurity knowledge, and our client
        wanted the following: to engage them in the game, encourage them to
        answer different challenges, and entertain them with fun, positive
        content. We will not be, however, making an education game, or creating
        the challenges ourselves.
        <br /><span class="element-title">past projects</span><br />
        The past picoCTF projects are great learning resources and the team all
        played the 2019 game which is the only one then-available.<br />
        Everything was fun till we were blocked by some of the harder challenges
        without answering which, the game wouldn’t progress. Being blocked by a
        single challenge and not able to experience the full story can be really
        frustrating. Also, the unwillingness to jump out of comfort zone and try
        challenges in different genre, as well as satisfying different taste,
        especially female contestants who used to be the minority.
