        HyperPickle is a client project built for picoCTF (Capture The Flag)
        2021, a two-week online cybersecurity competition. During the fall 2020
        semester, the team has built a game that's oriented around delivering a
        fun, engaging experience to attract people to join the competition -
        Adruppian Odyssey.

        is an annual two-week-long cybersecurity online competition held by the
        CMU CyLab. The competition has been popular among middle school to
        college students across the globe, and the collaboration between the ETC
        and CyLab has been successfully running for years with a game built each
        year for the competition. <br /><br />
        The games were designed primarily for middle school and high school
        students with little to intermediate knowledge in cybersecurity area.
        The lack of knowledge required necessarily to answer picoCTF challenges
        used to be a major setback when they were progressing the games that
        were dependent on challenges.<br /><br />
        To address the solution, I present Adruppian Odyssey, a resource
        management game with idle elements that features the ability to exchange
        resources and make friends with inhabitants while exploring the
        interesting, diverse Adruppy System.

        I had two roles. As co-producer:<br />
        - managed weekly sprints, communicating with our clients and the
        faculty;<br />
        - created visuals for branding materials;<br />
        As game designer:<br />
        - worked with the team to implement all game systems;<br />
        - orchestrated playtestings;<br />
        - improved user experience.<br />
        - summarized game design documents.<br />

      <div class="main-title">Pre-production</div>

        The team has spent the first four weeks in the semester understanding
        the project and getting prepared for full-production.

        <span class="element-title">understanding the goal</span><br />
        The salient point of working on a delivery project is to know the target
        audience and understand the client’s requirements, so as to set goals
        accordingly. During the communication, we got to know that the majority
        of contestants who try the game will be middle to high school students
        with little to intermediate cybersecurity knowledge, and our client
        wanted the following: to engage them in the game, encourage them to
        answer different challenges, and entertain them with fun, positive
        content. We will not be, however, making an education game, or creating
        the challenges ourselves.
        <br /><span class="element-title">design challenges</span><br />
        The past picoCTF projects are great learning resources. The team all
        played the 2019 game which was the only one available.<br />
        Everything was fun till we were blocked by some of the harder challenges
        without answering which, the game wouldn’t progress. Being blocked by a
        single challenge and not able to experience the full story can be
        somewhat frustrating. Adding to the conversations with our clients, all
        design challenges we faced included:<br />
        - challenges being frustrating obstacles, not the motivation;<br />
        - unwillingness to jump out of comfort zone and try challenges in a
        different genre;<br />
        - to satisfy different tastes, especially female contestants who used to
        be the minority.
        <br /><span class="element-title">game psychology study</span><br />
        In the meantime, I was also studying several game genres and looked into
        the psychological effects these games possess that keep players engaged
        for a relatively long time (<span class="link"

        With the problems defined and fundamental goal clarified, the team at
        the point headed to the game concept pitching phase smoothly.

        Game Pitches
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">brainstorming!</span><br />
        I helped the team facilitate the brainstorming process by focusing on
        the game challenges mentioned above, with the notion that knowing
        clearly what we would be doing in mind helps with the efficiency: we
        kept evaluating every idea before speaking them out!<br />
        The team pitched dozens of rough sketches which could be further
        categorized into a few genre: collection games, linear storytelling with
        light puzzle elements, walk simulator, and even deck-building games.<br />
        I suggested we looked at our pitches in a critical way: for this project
        it's really not about how novel the gameplay is, but if the gameplay
        meets the requirements and if it's doable in a semester.
        <br /><span class="element-title">narrowing down</span><br />
        Having absorbed design principles of existing games, I suggested that we
        could start off with solutions and build story and detailed game
        mechanics based on that, just like adding flesh to the skeleton.<br />
        At this stage we wanted to try different approaches that were showing
        some potential. Instead of doing paper prototyping, thanks to our
        programming resources, we quickly built several digital prototypes in
        Unity and started to check the "fun" factor. Communicating with our
        clients, and considering the team's skills, we decided to make our game
        less story-heavy, but instead to use game content's traits of strong
        progression to achieve our design goal.<br />
        We are exploring an innovative way to redefine the relationship between
        the game and the contest this year. Instead of letting the player’s
        progress in the contest determine the progress in the game, we are
        making a game that could stand on its own even when no CTF challenge is
        solved.
        <br /><span class="element-title">planning for production</span><br />
        By the end of fourth week into the semester, our vision of the game has
        been clear: we would be making a resource management game that uses
        light idle element to nudge players to try picoCTF challenges, and the
        motivation comes from progressions and advancing stories.

        System Design
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        As suggested by the order of this article, I used bottom-up design
        approach for this game, and the reason was pretty straight-forward: for
        this game we were more like solving a problem: how to motivate the
        players to engage in the contest? Bottom-up helps build a mechanism that
        would well justify our solutions.<br />
        <span class="element-title">core gameplay loop</span><br />
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/games/hyperpickle/gameplay-loop.png" />
        </div>
        <span class="element-title">economy</span><br />
        Creating a balanced, compelling economy for such a resource management
        game is practically the salient task for game designers. Making full use
        of picoCTF contest as a motivation in the game soon became my solution
        for the problem: the tokens obtained from answering challenges would be
        functioning as a mobile game premium currency, that can be used to help
        play the game more efficiently (so players will want it), but not as a
        block impeding the normal game process.

          <img src="/media/games/hyperpickle/economy.png" />
        </div>
        <span class="element-title">MDA Analysis</span><br />
        When designing the game systems, I used the MDA framework which helped
        me clarify the interconnections of systems and evaluate their efficacy
        in the later stage.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/games/hyperpickle/systems.png" />
        </div>
        <span class="element-title">progression system</span><br />
        Another thing we've been communicating with our clients was keeping
        players engaged during an as long as possible time period. The solution
        we came up with was the progression system. It's a big system with many
        components: basically, discovering new planets and upgrading the ship
        are all part of this system. What we did originally this year was the
        cosmetic items, namely the ship skins that player could unlock by
        obtaining pico challenge points. I designed these ship skin icons.

        Story
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        I created the game's story using the traditional "5W1H" framework. I
        paid special attention to its complexity and understandability to suit
        middle and high school students. <br />
        <div class="element-image">

        Visual Design
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        As the team didn't have a dedicated UI designer onboard, I took the
        responsibility of user experience and worked closely with the programmer
        and artists on the team to implement visual elements in the game.<br />
        <span class="element-title">visuals vs. text</span><br />
        Our game has a complex resource system. Instead of using texts
        everywhere, I suggested using icons for the recourses to keep the
        interface clean and organized. Also to enhance the visual unity, we
        replaced resource name texts with icons in most systems' UI.
        <br /><br />
        There's trade-offs too, of course, that it's hard for new players to
        recognize and remember those icons. To get around the problem, I
        suggested using mouse hover text to show the resource's name as it's
        pretty natural for people to hover their mouse over something they don't
        understand.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/games/hyperpickle/ui-1.jpg" />
        </div>
        <span class="element-title">icons</span><br />
        Since we didn't have a dedicated UI designer, I also helped design some
        functional icons in the game with the primary design goal - be clear as
        possible.

        Playtesting
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        I made the playtesting plan and work with the team and our clients to do
        three rounds of playtesting with different purposes:<br />
        - Usability playtest: this smaller-scaled playtest was mainly to find
        game glitches, check if the player understands the goal, and if the UI
        in the game is working as expected.<br />
        - Game components playtest: in this larger playtest, we invited people
        outside and inside the ETC to try out the full game build, asking if
        they understand the main mechanics of the game, and if they feel the
        economy (thr most important part) was balanced.<br />
        - Challenge playtest: in this final playtest before handing off the game
        to our clients, we let many players try the polished build running on
        the website, and use real 2019 CTF challenges, as if in the real
        contest, to determine if the game system successfully motivated the
        players to try challenges while they are in the travel.

          <img src="/media/games/hyperpickle/website-2.jpg" />
        </div>
        All three playtests proved to be successful in terms of massive feedback
        and suggestions that truly played a big part in our efforts to improve
        the game.

      <div class="main-design-title">

        Enhancing User Experience
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">tutorials</span><br />
        We realized the importance of adding tutorials in the game after the
        first round of playtesting. I tried multiple approaches to do this,
        including: <br />
        - A compulsory go-through of game systems in the onboarding section;<br />
        - Pure text tutorial, also during onboarding;<br />
        - Step-to-step how-to tutorial images, with a question mark indicating
        in the main game UI that indicates its helpfulness.<br /><br />
        With playtesters' and clients' feedback, we decided to use the third
        solution, because it's less forceful and saves space for story in the
        onboarding section, which would be an important plus for our middle to
        high school players.<br />
        While designing the tutorial images, I also paid attention to its
        readability and color theme. Here are two tutorial images used in the
        game. The semi-transparent black background covers the most UI, only
        exposing the part the help text is explaining.

        </div>

        <span class="element-title">tuning balance</span><br />
        During the third playtest we also asked directly in the survey their
        feeling about the game balance, and from the results we did hear some
        voice asking for buffing the pico tokens. In order to address the
        solution, we made traveling times between planets longer, but also
        buffed the token’s travel time reduction, to better encourage players to
        use tokens, and ultimately, to try pico challenges. In addition, we
        lowered the score threshold for contestants to get ship skins, according
        to the average score contestants obtained in 2019.

        Reusable Framework
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        Another technical advancement made with our client this year is that we
        were developing a reusable framework for future picoCTF games. The code
        for answering CTF challenges is separated from the companion game code,
        and is integrated with the picoCTF’s frontend web page. In this way,
        future game teams can focus on game development, without worrying about
        handling CTF challenges in game.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/games/hyperpickle/framework.png" />
        </div>
        <span class="element-title">configuration files</span><br />
        I worked with programmers to successfully create a configuration file
        that allows our client to modify some of our game's parameters when they
        have real challenges implemented.

        working with talented fellow students on such a great project, and we

        What Went Well
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        Overall, given the difficulty of delivering a polished robust game
        product, the team performed admirably in getting tasks done in as quick
        a manner as we possibly could.
        <br /><br />
        Product-wise speaking, our efforts in exploring and pivoting in the
        high-level game design from the previous games were unanimously
        acknowledged by both the faculty and our clients. The breakthrough can
        also be seen in an art style that no previous ETC teams has gone for,
        and the massive and well-organized in game systems that did the same job
        successfully: to engage players in a space journey, and try answering
        picoCTF challenges.
        <br /><br />
        In terms of the production, the team showed off the spirit of unity
        working closely together despite the physical separation from each
        other. Everyone on the team really got the chance to shine in the roles
        they wanted to play instead of the ones they were forced to fill, and
        contributed to the ultimate success by an equal share.

        What Could've Gone Better
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        The team had anticipated the difficulty of the remote working situation,
        however, to be honest, we probably could have been more communicative
        especially during the first month of the project when the team was doing
        fast idea iterations and cross-disciplinary communication was salient.
        To our relief, the team was able to address that point after the faculty
        meeting after Quarters, and had much smoother communication ever since.
