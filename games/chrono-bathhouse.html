        <div id="main-nav-text">Chrono Bathhouse is a business simulation game created in the hot summer of 2018. This is a group project and I worked as game designer, programmer and 2D artist(yes, almost all the work!).</div>

        <div class="main-content-description">The rule of Chrono Bathhouse is quite simple - to earn as much as you can in the restricted time. Slimes and Terra-cottas are the customers in this world and they appear and acts differently. I intended to add more diversed customers but that would take some more time.</div>
        <div class="main-content-title" id="art">Art</div>
        <div class="main-content-description">The 2D Art showed below is created by me as I thought some of the artwork does not fit the style. I tried to draw NPCs in a cuter way - making them appealing to the players as much as I can. The work is mainly about drawing different washing animations for each type of customers in each facility. Thankfully two kinds of slimes only differ in color, so I only need to draw one group of animations then change color style.</div>

        <div class="main-content-description">I spent most of my time doing the programming work. When collaborating with my workmates, I found that version controlling is of much importance as each of us do different parts in the programming. At last I had to download each member's script separately and debug on my own, adding much to my workload. And as we need to adjust many numerical values in the game, I rewrote the code to make it accessible in the Unity inspector as I can.</div>
