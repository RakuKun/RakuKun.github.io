      <div class="top-introduction">
        Building Virtual Worlds is a class in the first semester of Master of
        Entertainment Technology Program where I in teams of five take part as
        game designer and artist to make quick game prototypes on mostly non-PC
        platform. Each game takes one to three weeks.

      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">team setup</span><br />
        Two players controls a firetruck to fight the other two players. In a
        team, one person drives the firetruck and can press physical button to
        perform a dash; the other person controls the direction of water cannon
        and can press the button to spray water to knock the other firetruck
        back.
        <br /><span class="element-title">map</span><br />
        The map is a round-shaped island whose 3 outer rings will fall during
        the game. There is a center fire hydrant which sprays powerful water.
        <br /><span class="element-title">energy system</span><br />
        Every player has energy that replenishes automatically every 2 seconds.
        Pressing the button will use all the current energy and make the
        firetruck dash forward/spray water according to the role. The game will
        be randomly spawning powerups on the map that replenish the energy bar
        to full immediately.
        <div class="element-image">

        </div>
        <span class="element-title">game end</span><br />
        A game ends when one firetruck gets off the ground for any reasons, by
        which the opposite side wins. Every match is best of three so losing one
        game doesn't mean losing it all.

        </div>
        <span class="element-title">asymmetrical role</span><br />
        One player drives the firetruck, another controls the water cannon. By
        assigning different abilities we make players stay connected to each
        other and communicate along the game.
        <br /><span class="element-title">controlled chaos</span><br />
        We love to have a little chaos in the game as randomness is an easy way
        to add fun. However, it also needs control so that winning the game is
        not totally by luck. In our game we have designed two semi-random
        events:<br />
        1. The central fire hydrant will spray water every fixed time, but
        randomly at some of 4 directions. <br />
        2. Overtime powerups will be spawned on the map, and we control the
        distribution and kind so one team will not continuously luck out.<br />
        In a word, we don't like 100% skill or 100% luck game. The randomness
        must be well controlled to not overwhelm players’ performance.
        <br /><span class="element-title">limited gametime</span><br />
        Playing such fast paced game is physically and mentally challenging so
        we want each round no longer than 2 minutes.<br />
        The island rings fall and battleground gets smaller overtime, making the
        battle more intense and game end more quickly.

        <span class="element-title">clearer instructions</span><br />
        Before putting our game to BVW Festival there was almost no tutorial so
        we have to tell players manually how to play and win the game, and
        sometimes delivering rules orally could cause misunderstanding. So I
        make two slides for instructions and show them on a TV screen near
        Jam-O-Drum.
        <div class="element-image-flex">

        <span class="element-title">balance</span><br />
        Most players claim that driving the firetruck feels actually harder than
        spraying water. It is not a bad thing to have a diverse role difficulty
        inside a team, but we need to clarify it in the first place or players
        might get frustrated for underperforming.

      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">easy story</span><br />
        It will be a 4 minute experience including interaction time, so we don't
        want a too complicated story. We choose to make a classroom romance
        story since it is a universally common theme easy for everyone to
        understand.
        <br /><span class="element-title">meaningful story</span><br />
        We get advice from professors that to make the story truly convincing,
        every step should have a motivation. Why is this day so important that
        the character is daydreaming about his girl? Why does the girl accept
        the love letter?<br />
        We answer these questions by putting a calendar in the start scene,
        indicating that they already know each other, and the boy waits for this
        day to profess his love to her. To make a complete story, we have the
        same scene (at night) in the ending, with changes on the calendar.
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img
            src="/media/games/bvw/promposal-3.jpeg"
            alt="Promposal Start Scene"
          />
          <img

            alt="Promposal End Scene"
          />
        </div>
        Additionally, we think adding a little surprise in the story would help
        the emotional flow, while the story shouldn't break main story trend. So
        we introduces a super handsome guy seemingly coming out of nowhere just
        to win the girl, yet his prompt actually gets declined.
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img

        What Remains of Edith Finch inspires me most in combining interactions
        with story. We leave important moments waiting to be accomplished by
        player so they feel really being in the situation rather than watching
        passively the story happen.<br />
        Another thing from this game that hits me is the use of metaphor. What
        Remains of Edith Finch uses visual languages to imply psychological
        activities, and I want to use the same to represent love. So in our game
        we have scenes jumping between dreams and reality, with the huge
        difference in tones and actions to show the character's love for the
        girl.

        Design Process
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">idea iteration</span><br />
        We spent much time iterating each story and interaction. Below are some
        very early-stage idea sketches.
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img
            src="/media/games/bvw/promposal-1.jpeg"
            alt="Promposal Sketch 1"
          />
          <img
            src="/media/games/bvw/promposal-2.jpeg"
            alt="Promposal Sketch 2"
          />
        </div>
        After determining the theme, we started off ideation by thinking of
        activities that best represent school love. I come up with ideas using
        metaphor mentioned above to create an illusion-esque feeling of love,
        and we together designed several actions that is reasonable in the
        classroom and suitable for VR.<br />
        During the interim the majority of feedback we got was that the
        interaction is cool, but many don't quite understand the story and the
        ending (a handsome guy breaks in and takes the girl) is quite
        frustrating. So we make the start scene and redo the ending to make it
        kind of more conservative but reasonable.
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-title">
        <hr />
        Post-Mortem
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">deliver more clearly</span><br />
        Some players have a hard time figuring out how the story and interaction
        is connected. And it is hard to have the same feeling as What Remains of
        Edith Finch as we are short on art and sound resources. So it might be
        better if we deliver the interaction in a clearer way with less
        metaphors.
        <br /><span class="element-title">do playtests many as possible</span
        ><br />
        More playtesters help more in finding bugs and testing the interactions.
        If they don’t understand, that is probably we are making it too
        complicated. This doesn't necessarily mean that we need to cut the story
        to cater for everyone's taste, but do it in a more understandable way.

      <div class="main-design-description">
        Paramania is an immersive puzzle solving game featuring an adventure in
        a Pyramid. The pyramid has a theme of light so basically all our puzzles
        are built around using the features of light: lighting up environment,
        reflection, color blending, etc. All interactions can be done using a
        VIVE controller.<br />
        There is a guide in the game (which is me) who leads players through the
        first scene, introducing the backstory and informing players to use the
        torch. After entering the pyramid the players will have to solve the
        puzzles on their own.

        At the early stage the game merely consists of multiple puzzles with
        little transition between each other, which for most players could be
        tedious. I then suggested that we have pre-scripted animations between
        two puzzles so the experience will have its relaxed and intense part.<br />
        Also, we want our game to have a epic and happy ending where players can
        actually see how the evil Pharoah's resurrection is ruined. So I make a
        pre-scripted clip for the ending:

        At first we have many ideas about puzzles and they all seem to work in
        some way. But after several we find that have just one unified theme for
        all puzzles will make it clearer for players and easier to control the
        difficulty for designers. We decided on "light" as our core element as
        it is COOL and uses CAVE environment in a smart way.

        <span class="element-title">think of hardware</span><br />
        We are putting players into a very special game environment where they
        are surrounded by three large screens so they are like ‘inside’ the game
        world. This is an excellent chance for us to make a fully immersive game
        so we start the exploration finding concept for a Egyptian pyramid where
        adventurers go and find treasures by solving puzzles.
        <br /><span class="element-title">idea iteration</span><br />
        We begin with thinking some possible interesting mechanism that could
        utilize the specialty of CAVE, they are: light reflection and
        refraction, matching patterns, triggering with flashlight, and drawing.
        Our first playable prototype was a mixture of different kinds of puzzles
        but later we all agreed that "light reflection" is the most suitable
        mechanism.

        We have some really nice puzzles and our environment really has Egyptian
        feeling, but that doesn’t work very well if the experience is way too
        long. In the video where naive guests play, they actually need 9 minutes
        to go through the game, which is much beyond the expected 6 minutes. It
        turns out we still need more playtests as new players may need more time
        to understand mechanics and enjoy the story.
