        <div id="main-nav-title">Building Virtual Worlds</div>
        <div id="main-nav-text">Building Virtual Worlds is one of the courses in my first semester in the Entertainment
            Technology Center, CMU. Interdisciplinary teams build rapidly prototyped immersive interactive virtual
            worlds. The course will cover world
            building, environmental design, non-linear storytelling, and related topics. My roles are usually game
            designer and 3D artist and sometimes I work on Unity programming and shaders.</div>
        <div class="main-content-title" id="round1">Round 1</div>
        <div class="main-content-description">Round 1's theme is "help" and our team created a game "Sneaker" which is
            about directing a robot to get out of enemy zones. The hardware platform was MagicLeap AR. I took part in
            designing the game mechanics, creating player robot and doing shader effects.

        <div class="main-content-title" id="round2">Round 2</div>
        <div class="main-content-description">Round 2 was about creating a sense of "feeling free". Our game in Vive VR
            is about playing as a bird and flying to islands to find other birds who offer to colorfy our feather. My
            work includes game design, world layout, 3D modelling for the birds and animations.</div>

        <div class="main-content-title" id="round3">Round 3</div>
        <div class="main-content-description">Round 3 is a lightning round of just one week for creating games that
            offer simply fun, replayable experience. Our game uses Jam-O-Drum hardware and made a game where we put four
            players on a collapsing island and to control firetrucks 2v2. I participated in game design, 3D art as well
            as programming for visual arts</div>

        <div class="main-content-title" id="round4">Round 4</div>
        <div class="main-content-description">Round 4 a storytelling round. Our team built a game about school love
            using Oculus VR. During the experience players go through a short love story travelling between a dream
            world and reality. I created the game structure, designed game mechanics, made all human models and animated
            them.</div>
