      <div class="top-introduction">
        Designing multiplayer combat experience has alway been a very
        interesting topic for me, so I want this page to cover some thoughts and
        trying of designing small-scale multiplayer combat zone, preferably 1v1
        and 2v2.

        I have been watching some top streamers on Twitch playing Call of Duty:
        Warzone quite a bit recently. Among many interesting game mechanics, the
        desperate 1v1 gunfight in a fictional gulag attracts me most for its
        dramatically fast-paced combat and the rule that only the winner can
        step back into the battlefield.

        <span class="element-title">what's gulag?</span><br />
        As a Battle Royale game, Call of Duty: Warzone is praised for its
        fast-paced and Call-of-Duty-esque feeling of gunfight. A player is put
        into the gulag if and only after they get killed in the game for the
        first time, so gulag is a chance for everyone to push back to the main
        game - if they manage to win there.<br /><br />
        A one versus one fight is prepared for everyone in the gulag, and some
        special rules apply: the system will pick a gun (or not!) randomly for
        both sides, and/or some equipments such as flash grenades or C4. The
        health does not regenerate here, and each round only has 40 seconds,
        with a "overtime" setting where players can also capture the flag in the
        middle of the map to win.
        <br />
        Here's the link to the official

        <br /><span class="element-title">why gulag?</span><br />
        The gulag is designed, along with many other unique systems in Warzone,
        in order that players can MAXIMIZE their playtime in the game and keep
        excited. Similar to the main game where TTK (time to kill) is relatively
        short compared to other Battle Royale games, gunfights in gulag also try
        to make battle short and exciting. The higher the risk, the better the
        reward.<br /><br />
        In the gulag map, many factors work successfully together to make the
        gunfight fast and intense. I want to discuss how designers achieve their
        goals by looking into the 2d and 3d layout of the map.
        <br /><span class="element-title">map: 2d</span><br />
        According to the official guide, the 1v1 fight can take place randomly
        at one of the following three maps.
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/games/combat-zone/gulag-1.jpg" />
          <img src="/media/games/combat-zone/gulag-2.jpg" />
          <img src="/media/games/combat-zone/gulag-3.jpg" />
        </div>
        From 2d layouts we can find the three maps share some things in
        common:<br />
        - <span class="bold">Rigidly axial symmetric layout.</span> It's
        probably the most important thing in any competitive games that both
        sides play fairly, and the most straightforward thing is make a
        symmetrical map so they play under the same circumstances. <br />
        -
        <span class="bold"
          >Single-floor and small map with lots of obstacles blocking the
          sight.</span
        >
        From the purpose of gulag, we know that designers want this combat to be
        quick and decisive, which pushes the map to be simple and understandable
        as possible. But being simple does not means being easy: the players
        should be put into a challenging enough environment where they need to
        use everything they're provided to win.<br />
        -
        <span class="bold"
          >A perimeter balcony above where idle prisoners can observe the
          ground. </span
        >No doubt this design gives advantage to the players who have teammates
        in the jail, which is a really interesting design to keep them away from
        boredom. <br /><span class="element-title">map: 3d</span><br />
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/games/combat-zone/gulag-3d.jpg" />
        </div>
        One very important design I found about the three gulag map is that,
        most walls are so TALL that players cannot peek upwards, but have to
        peek left/right, which adds to the odds they get killed.<br />
        This design again forces the players to take higher risks in the fight,
        by moving closer to the enemy or exposing a larger part of the body.<br /><br />

        Different from the stealth level, the environment in combat levels are
