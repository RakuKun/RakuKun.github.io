        As a game designer I pay special attention to level design and how it
        works with other game elements such as quest and story. This page
        showcases some of my ongoing level design work
        <br />I am still designing and from time to time more content will be
        added.

        <span class="element-title">asymmetrical role</span><br />
        One player drives the firetruck, another controls the water cannon. By
        assigning different abilities we make players stay connected to each
        other and communicate along the game.
        <br /><span class="element-title">unavoidable conflict</span><br />
        It is supposed to be a fast paced game no longer than 2 minutes each
        round. The battleground gets smaller as the game goes on, players will
        have to fight more intensely. Reasonable randomness. For competitive
        games people are expecting each round to be different (and the result as
        well). It’s not good to be 100% skill or 100% luck, so adding a little
        randomness will help the game gets fun. The randomness must be well
        controlled to not overwhelm players’ performance. <br />
        <span class="element-title">visual instructions</span><br />
        Tell the players what will happen in game and make them understand the
        situation.

        <span class="element-title">clearer instructions</span><br />
        There is almost no tutorial so we have to tell players manually how to
        play and win the game.
        <br /><span class="element-title">balance</span><br />
        Most players claim that driving is actually harder than spraying water.
        It is not a bad thing to have a diverse job difficulty inside a team,
        but we need to clarify it in the first place or players might get
        frustrated for underperforming.
