        Level Design (ongoing)
      </div>
      <div class="top-introduction">
        As a game designer I pay special attention to level design and how it
        works with other game elements such as quest and story. This page
        showcases some of my ongoing level design work. The complete level runs
        in Unreal Engine and I use Adobe Illustrator and Maya for layout.
        <br />I am still designing and from time to time more content will be
        added.

        From the experience of several stealth games I want to analyze what
        makes them fun and try making a brief stealth level by myself.

        element analysis
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        Just like other games, there are some fundamental elements in stealth
        games: a start, a goal, game rules, and obstacles.<br />
        <span class="element-title">start</span><br />in stealth games usually
        The start point is a relatively safe place that is far away from
        destination. No challenges at the beginning means players have
        sufficient time to get prepared such as grabbing some equipments and
        inspecting the level at a higher location. To make the game more
        challenging, the players may not be able to come back once they set off,
        just like other linear level flow. <br />
        <span class="element-title">goal</span><br />
        The goal in stealth game is very diverse but has something in common:
        mostly some fixed points (treasure, exit, important person, etc.). Some
        games would ask the players to escape once they reach the goal (kill a
        person probably), and the game pace could change a lot in the escape
        phase, which adds excitement and up-n-downs to the emotion flow. <br />
        <span class="element-title">rules</span><br />
        The principle of designing rules for stealth games is never to make the
        playable character too strong that they can even confront a group of
        armed enemies. Giving ability to engage is dangerous in the sense that a
        stealth experience may turn into Call of Duty. As a compensation, the
        character is offered some skills or items so they can pass through
        enemies unnoticed.<br />
        <span class="element-title">obstacles</span><br />
        There are usually a group of enemies either in fixed points or wandering
        certain routes, trying to find and catch the playable character. They
        outnumber the character so it is hard once got into combat, but for a
        playable level their actions must be predictable so the players can have
        strategy and plan ahead.

        pitfalls
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        Here are some pitfalls I find before or after playtesting my level.<br />
        <span class="element-title">the avoid-'em-all path</span><br />
        The avoid-'em-all path is a route by which the character have zero
        chance of being noticed. It usually happens when all enemies' patrol
        routes don't overlap with the character's route. This bad design could
        make the level very boring as the players don't need to think, they just
        go and win.<br />
        <span class="element-title">unpredictable AI</span><br />
        Unpredictable AI is that pre-scripted enemies don't follow a fixed path,
        or have sudden turn back, or moves too fast. Unpredictable AI makes the
        game hard in an annoying not challenging way, as the random events would
        kill player's plan and mess up the level.<br />
        <span class="element-title">the forced way</span><br />
        Many stealth games let playable character have items or weapons. This is
        nice as the players are granted a variety of ways to beat the level. But
        this could also be a pain when some items are designed very specifically
        for one level or even one point in level, and the players cannot beat
        the level if they don't have that. It is always better to provide
        possibility for trying new ways to explore than limiting the gameplay to
        one answer.

        2D Layout
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        At pre-engine phase I use Adobe Illustrator to sketch the level and use
        some legend for the playable character, enemies and goal.
      </div>

      <div class="main-title">
        Third Person Story Driven
      </div>
      <div class="main-image"></div>
      <div class="main-introduction">
        This is a level specifically developed for exploring the third person
        experience driven by a story. The design is currently in 3D sketch
        phase.

        element analysis
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        I consider it very important to analyze the level element and how it
        connects the story before sketching.<br />
        <span class="element-title">start</span><br />In this level, the
        playable character is spawned at a place where they can have a overview
        of the first part of the level and are able to draw a very rough sketch
        of routes they will be taking. Compared to stealth level, there is more
        unknown at the beginning, leaving room for a surprising story.<br />
        <span class="element-title">goal</span><br />
        The first and told goal in this level is to reach a space where treasure
        locates. After getting the treasure, the place start to collapse and the
        character needs to escape which means to get to another place. I try
        this two-step goal to see how level and goal influences player's emotion
        flow.<br />
        <span class="element-title">rules</span><br />
        In the planned early demo, the only actions playable character can do is
        running and jumping. The basic movement allows players to get to most
        places they see, and it is easier for me to do layout as I don't need to
        consider the interaction between enemies for now.<br />
        <span class="element-title">obstacles</span><br />
        Traditionally games would put puzzles before treasure so the player
        would feel very satisfied to get the treasure. In my case, the puzzle is
        replaced with a long path and some puzzle-like mechanism. After getting
        the treasure, the scene will change and the character need to escape
        where they are within limited time.

        layout
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">2D layout</span><br />
        I start design doing 2D layout as it is the fastest way for iteration
        and prototyping. The 2D sketch mainly shows the path and possible
        enemies and items. Up and downs in terrain is marked with different
        color.
        <br /><span class="element-title">3D layout</span><br />
        Once the basic level structure and narrative element is determined, I
        will start doing 3D layout. The content is to be added soon!
