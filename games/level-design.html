        As a game designer I pay special attention to level design and how it
        works with other game elements such as quest and story. This page
        showcases some of my ongoing level design work. The complete level runs
        in Unreal Engine and I use Adobe Illustrator and Maya for layout.
        <br />I am still designing and from time to time more content will be
        added.

        Third Person Stealth
      </div>
      <div class="main-introduction" style="width: 100%;">
        Stealth game became a serious game genre after Metal Gear Solid came
        out. Its third person perspective gameplay, combined with dramatic plot
        and the thrilling feeling taking down enemies, fascinates players who
        want something different from a shoot-'em-up.

        element analysis
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        From the experience of several stealth games I want to analyze what
        makes them fun and try making a brief stealth level by myself. Just like
        other games, there are some fundamental elements in stealth games: a
        start, a goal, game rules, and obstacles.<br />
        <span class="element-title">start</span><br />
        In stealth games, usually, the start point is a relatively safe place
        distant from destination. No challenges at the beginning means players
        have sufficient time to get prepared such as grabbing some equipments
        and inspecting the level to make a plan. To make the game more
        challenging, the players may not be able to come back once they set off,
        so each run needs to be well prepared. <br />
        <span class="element-title">goal</span><br />
        The goal in stealth game is very diverse but has something in common:
        mostly some fixed points (treasure, exit, important person, etc.) Some
        games would ask the players to escape once they reach the goal (kill a
        person probably), and the game pace could change a lot in the escape
        phase, which adds excitement and up-n-downs to the emotion flow. <br />
        <span class="element-title">rules</span><br />
        The principle of designing rules for stealth games is never to make the
        playable character too strong that they can even confront a group of
        armed enemies. Giving ability to engage is dangerous in the sense that a
        stealth experience may turn into Call of Duty. As a compensation, the
        character is offered some skills or items so they can pass through
        enemies unnoticed.<br />
        <span class="element-title">obstacles</span><br />
        There are usually a group of enemies either in fixed points or wandering
        certain routes, trying to find and catch the playable character. They
        outnumber the character so it is hard once got into combat, but for a
        playable level their actions must be predictable so the players can have
        strategy and plan ahead.

        pitfalls
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        Here are some pitfalls I find before or after playtesting my level.<br />
        <span class="element-title">god path</span><br />
        The god path is a route by which the character have zero chance of being
        noticed. It usually happens when all enemies' patrol routes don't
        overlap with the character's route. This bad design could make the level
        very boring as the players don't need to think, they just go and win.<br />
        <span class="element-title">unpredictable AI</span><br />
        Unpredictable AI is that pre-scripted enemies don't follow a fixed path,
        or have sudden turn back, or moves too fast. Unpredictable AI makes the
        game hard in an annoying not challenging way, as the random events would
        kill player's plan and mess up the level.<br />
        <span class="element-title">forced gameplay</span><br />
        Many stealth games let playable character have items or weapons. This is
        nice as the players are granted a variety of ways to beat the level. But
        this could also be a pain when some items are designed very specifically
        for one level or even one point in level, and the players cannot beat
        the level if they don't have that. It is always better to provide
        possibility for trying new ways to explore than limiting the gameplay to
        one answer.

        core mechanism
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        Core mechanism will cover the stealth game's basic rules and gameplay,
        including the action set the character has, enemy types and most
        importantly, the goal and walkthrough of the game.
        <br /><span class="element-title">character's actions</span><br />
        -Character can walk and run (2 times the speed of walking).<br />
        -Character can knock down enemies in melee range.<br />
        -Character will have to interact with the trigger item.<br />
        <span class="element-title">enemy AI</span><br />
        -Enemies have fixed patrol. They switch between standing still and
        walking.<br />
        -Enemies have fixed vision cone inside which the character will be
        detected.<br />
        -Enemies will engage when they spot the character.<br />
        -Enemies will be alerted if they find a body.<br />
        <span class="element-title">goal</span><br />
        -The game consists of two sequential goals.<br />
        -The first goal is to get to the map point and trigger the objective -
        to cut off electricity. The second goal is to get the intel located
        inside the mansion.<br />
        - Two goals are in the same map, but in different scenes and enemy AI
        will change once the first goal is achieved.<br />
        After deciding the core gameplay, I could begin sketching the level in
        2D illustration which determines the basic layout and possible routes
        for players.

        layout in 2d
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        At pre-programming phase I use Adobe Illustrator to block out the level
        and use some legends for the playable character, enemies and goal. I
        would like to make 2 major scenes in the game: the outdoor scene and the
        indoor scene. The first goal only requires outdoor actions while the
        second goal needs the character sneak into the mansion and stealth in a
        more limited space.

        prototyping in 3d
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        After having a sketch of the map layout, I could start prototyping and
        iterating the experience in third person perspective in a 3D environment
        with the help of game engine.
        <br /><span class="element-title">translating</span><br />
        Putting a 2D map into 3D is not simply replacing everything with cubes.
        With a higher dimension, I need to think of how to translate faithfully
        and efficiently:<br />
        -Pay special attention to the height difference. Height difference would
        matter a lot in determining the visibility, and engaging enemies from a
        higher place is possible but is almost impossible from a lower place.<br />
        -Lines in 3D world have height and thickness. Walls are key components
        in stealth games as they block sights.<br />
        -Consider in a dynamic point of view. Enemies have vision cones and as
        they move, they are observing different places.<br />

        This is a level specifically developed for exploring the third person

        element analysis
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        I consider it very important to analyze the level element and how it
        connects the story before sketching.<br />
        <span class="element-title">start</span><br />In this level, the
        playable character is spawned at a place where they can have a overview
        of the first part of the level and are able to draw a very rough sketch
        of routes they will be taking. Compared to stealth level, there is more
        unknown at the beginning, leaving room for a surprising story.<br />
        <span class="element-title">goal</span><br />
        The first and told goal in this level is to reach a space where treasure
        locates. After getting the treasure, the place start to collapse and the
        character needs to escape which means to get to another place. I try
        this two-step goal to see how level and goal influences player's emotion
        flow.<br />
        <span class="element-title">rules</span><br />
        In the planned early demo, the only actions playable character can do is
        running and jumping. The basic movement allows players to get to most
        places they see, and it is easier for me to do layout as I don't need to
        consider the interaction between enemies for now.<br />
        <span class="element-title">obstacles</span><br />
        Traditionally games would put puzzles before treasure so the player
        would feel very satisfied to get the treasure. In my case, the puzzle is
        replaced with a long path and some puzzle-like mechanism. After getting
        the treasure, the scene will change and the character need to escape
        where they are within limited time.

        layout
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">2D layout</span><br />
        I start design doing 2D layout as it is the fastest way for iteration
        and prototyping. The 2D sketch mainly shows the path and possible
        enemies and items. Up and downs in terrain is marked with different
        color.
        <br /><span class="element-title">3D layout</span><br />
        Once the basic level structure and narrative element is determined, I
        will start doing 3D layout. The content is to be added soon!
