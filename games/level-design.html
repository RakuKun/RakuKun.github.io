        As a game designer I pay special attention to level design and how it
        works with other game elements such as quest system and narrative. This

        Stealth Design Theory
      </div>
      <div class="main-description">
        Stealth game became a serious game genre after Metal Gear Solid came
        out. Its third person perspective gameplay, combined with dramatic plot
        and the thrilling feeling taking down enemies, fascinates players who
        want something different from a shoot-'em-up.

        element analysis
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        From the experience of several stealth games I want to analyze what
        makes them fun and try making a brief stealth level by myself. Just like
        other games, there are some fundamental elements in stealth games: a
        start, a goal, game rules, and obstacles.
        <br /><span class="element-title">start</span><br />
        In stealth games, usually, the start point is a relatively safe place
        distant from destination. No challenges at the beginning means players
        have sufficient time to get prepared such as grabbing some equipments
        and inspecting the level to make a plan. To make the game more
        challenging, the players may not be able to come back once they set off,
        so each run needs to be well prepared. <br />
        <span class="element-title">goal</span><br />
        The goal in stealth game is very diverse but has something in common:
        mostly some fixed points (treasure, exit, important person, etc.) Some
        games would ask the players to escape once they reach the goal (kill a
        person probably), and the game pace could change a lot in the escape
        phase, which adds excitement and up & downs to the emotion flow. <br />
        <span class="element-title">rules</span><br />
        The principle of designing rules for stealth games is never to make the
        playable character too strong that they can even confront a group of
        armed enemies. Giving ability to engage is dangerous in the sense that a
        stealth experience may turn into Call of Duty. As a compensation, the
        character is offered some skills or items so they can pass through
        enemies unnoticed.<br />
        <span class="element-title">obstacles</span><br />
        There are usually a group of enemies either in fixed points or wandering
        certain routes, trying to find and catch the playable character. They
        outnumber the character so it is hard once got into combat, but for a
        playable level their actions must be predictable so the players can have
        strategy and plan ahead.

        pitfalls
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">god path</span><br />
        The god path is a route by which the character have zero chance of being
        noticed. It usually happens when all enemies' patrol routes don't
        overlap with the character's route. This bad design could make the level
        very boring as the players don't need to think, they just go and win.<br /><br />
        Another example of god path is the unfair vantage point, where players
        are allowed to attack enemy from distance while they cannot fight back.
        Again, every game need to balance its challenge and reward. God path
        avoids all challenges, thus causing a broken game setup.<br />
        <span class="element-title">unpredictable AI</span><br />
        Unpredictable AI means pre-scripted enemies don't follow a fixed path,
        or have sudden turn back, or moves too fast. Unpredictable AI makes the
        game hard in an annoying but not challenging way, as the random events
        would kill every plan and mess up the level.<br />
        <span class="element-title">forced gameplay</span><br />
        Many stealth games let playable character have items or weapons. This is
        nice as the players are granted a variety of ways to beat the level. But
        this could also be a pain when some items are designed very specifically
        for one level or even one point in level, and the players cannot beat
        the level if they don't have that. It is always better to provide
        possibility for trying new ways to explore than limiting the gameplay to
        one answer.

        <span class="element-title">Splinter Cell: Blacklist</span><br />
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/games/level-design/stealth/blacklist.jpg" />
          <img src="/media/games/level-design/stealth/blacklist2.jpg" />
        </div>
        Splinter Cell: Blacklist is the stealth game that I'm mostly getting
        inspired from, and this stealth level project is like the re-creation of
        one of its levels call Private Estate. A scenario set at night, Private
        Estate serves as a great example of the use of light, enemy AI, and
        exterior and interior design of a typical stealth level.
        <br />
        <span class="element-title">MGS V: Phantom Pain</span>
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/games/level-design/stealth/mgsv.jpg" />
        </div>
        Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain is a critically claimed stealth title
        from one of my favorite game director, Hideo Kojima. I like its
        day-night system, which adds different fun and strategy to a single map.
        Again, MGSV teaches a good lesson on how crucial lighting in dark
        scenes.
        <br />
        <span class="element-title">Uncharted 4</span>
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/games/level-design/stealth/uncharted4.jpg" />
        </div>
        Although Uncharted 4 is not a stealth game, some of its levels cleverly
        add stealth element to make the game feel diverse and interesting.
        What's more, the way it tells a continuous story using level design is a
        great source for learning. The picture above comes from "get out of the
        orphanage" scenario in chapter 1, which shows the players a segment of
        Nathan Drake's childhood.<br /><br />
        This level did another point extremely well: make waiting time
        interesting. Usually in stealth levels players need to wait for enemies
        to pass or turn around, and the process can be tedious. Uncharted 4,
        however, makes NPCs talk and act all the time, so that players can
        concentrate and get information useful to understand the story. It's
        indeed a clever move.

      <div class="main-design-description">
        During design phase I used Adobe Illustrator to block out the level and
        use some legends for the playable character, enemies and goal. I would
        like to make 2 major scenes in the game: the outdoor scene and the
        indoor scene. The first goal is set outside the mansion while the second
        goal needs the character to sneak into the mansion and stealth in a more
        constraint area.

        3d modelling
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        After having a layout sketch, I started 3d modelling with Maya. Putting
        2D maps into a 3D world is not simply replacing lines with cubes. I need
        to think how to translate the design faithfully and efficiently:<br />
        -Pay special attention to the height difference. Height difference would
        matter a lot in determining the visibility, and engaging enemies from a
        higher place is possible but is almost impossible from a lower place.<br />
        -Lines in 3D world have height and thickness. Wall is a key component in
        3D stealth games as it blocks sights and gives space for players to hide
        and ambush, so it plays a key role in game balance, and that's why the
        height and thickness is so important.<br />
        -Think in a dynamic point of view. Enemies have vision cones and as they
        move, they are observing different places. As I programmed the whole
        game system, there are way more details that needs careful thoughts.

        level design
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        I used Blueprint to do all the game logic, including enemy AI,
        patrolling system, and game start/over. And it's also a step where I can
        watch how level runs and adjust accordingly.
        <br /><span class="element-title">patrol system</span><br />
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/games/level-design/stealth/patrol-1.png" />

        </div>
        <br /><span class="element-title">mesh & color</span><br />
        Although the purpose of this level is not to make an environment design
        portfolio, I built the level in medium details, especially for places
        that should attract more attention. Coloring the mesh is also important,
        as it gives a sense of what function the mesh serves.
        <br /><span class="element-title">lighting</span><br />
        Lighting plays an significant role in night scenes. In the level
        lighting was used mostly to indicate important locations and direct the
        players. I tried to use different colors for different purposes: yellow
        means common places, white can be seen at the entrance of large area,
        light yellow is used for enemies' flashlights.
        <br /><span class="element-title">collectibles</span><br />
        Collectibles are commonly used in games to reward those who have
        curiosity and patience to explore every corner of the world. To fill the
        world with more content, I also use collectibles to enrich some not very
        eye-catching routes.

      <div class="main-design-description">
        I consider playtesting a crucial part of level design, especially when I
        realized the magic it plays to bring a 6/10 level to 8 points. (or
        higher!)
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/games/level-design/stealth/iteration-1.png" />
        </div>
        The first feedback from a professional includes changing the position of
        vantage point and adding more direction along the level so the player
        can keep track of where they are and know where is the destination. I
        also noticed that enemy patrol routes are so easy that there's actually
        "god path" which is mentioned earlier as a pitfall in stealth level. As
        a result, I re-designed exterior area and enemy patrol routes.
