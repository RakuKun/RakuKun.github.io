      <div class="top-introduction">
        As a game designer I pay special attention to level design and how it
        works with other game elements such as quest system and narrative. This
        page showcases some of my ongoing level design work. The complete level
        runs in Unreal Engine 4, and I use Adobe Illustrator and Maya for
        layout.

        Stealth Design Theory
      </div>
      <div class="main-description">
        Stealth game became a serious game genre after Metal Gear Solid came
        out. Its third person perspective gameplay, combined with dramatic plot
        and the thrilling feeling taking down enemies, fascinates players who
        want something different from a shoot-'em-up.

        element analysis
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        From the experience of several stealth games I want to analyze what
        makes them fun and try making a brief stealth level by myself. Just like
        other games, there are some fundamental elements in stealth games: a
        start, a goal, game rules, and obstacles.
        <span class="element-title">start</span><br />
        In stealth games, usually, the start point is a relatively safe place
        distant from destination. No challenges at the beginning means players
        have sufficient time to get prepared such as grabbing some equipments
        and inspecting the level to make a plan. To make the game more
        challenging, the players may not be able to come back once they set off,
        so each run needs to be well prepared. <br />
        <span class="element-title">goal</span><br />
        The goal in stealth game is very diverse but has something in common:
        mostly some fixed points (treasure, exit, important person, etc.) Some
        games would ask the players to escape once they reach the goal (kill a
        person probably), and the game pace could change a lot in the escape
        phase, which adds excitement and up-n-downs to the emotion flow. <br />
        <span class="element-title">rules</span><br />
        The principle of designing rules for stealth games is never to make the
        playable character too strong that they can even confront a group of
        armed enemies. Giving ability to engage is dangerous in the sense that a
        stealth experience may turn into Call of Duty. As a compensation, the
        character is offered some skills or items so they can pass through
        enemies unnoticed.<br />
        <span class="element-title">obstacles</span><br />
        There are usually a group of enemies either in fixed points or wandering
        certain routes, trying to find and catch the playable character. They
        outnumber the character so it is hard once got into combat, but for a
        playable level their actions must be predictable so the players can have
        strategy and plan ahead.

        pitfalls
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        Here are some pitfalls I find before or after playtesting my level.<br />
        <span class="element-title">god path</span><br />
        The god path is a route by which the character have zero chance of being
        noticed. It usually happens when all enemies' patrol routes don't
        overlap with the character's route. This bad design could make the level
        very boring as the players don't need to think, they just go and win.<br />
        <span class="element-title">unpredictable AI</span><br />
        Unpredictable AI is that pre-scripted enemies don't follow a fixed path,
        or have sudden turn back, or moves too fast. Unpredictable AI makes the
        game hard in an annoying not challenging way, as the random events would
        kill player's plan and mess up the level.<br />
        <span class="element-title">forced gameplay</span><br />
        Many stealth games let playable character have items or weapons. This is
        nice as the players are granted a variety of ways to beat the level. But
        this could also be a pain when some items are designed very specifically
        for one level or even one point in level, and the players cannot beat
        the level if they don't have that. It is always better to provide
        possibility for trying new ways to explore than limiting the gameplay to
        one answer.

        Core mechanism will cover the stealth game's basic rules and gameplay,
        including the action set the character has, enemy types and most
        importantly, the goal and walkthrough of the game.
        <br /><span class="element-title">character's actions</span><br />
        -Character can walk and run (2 times the speed of walking).<br />
        -Character can knock down enemies in melee range.<br />
        -Character will have to interact with the trigger item.<br />
        <span class="element-title">enemy AI</span><br />
        -Enemies have fixed patrol. Their move pattern will be one of three:
        looping, ping-pong, or being still.<br />
        -Enemies have fixed vision cone inside which the character will be
        detected.<br />
        -Enemies will engage when they find character in a very close
        distance.<br />
        -Enemies will be alerted if they find a body.<br />
        <span class="element-title">goal</span><br />
        -The game consists of two sequential goals.<br />
        -The first goal is to get to the map point and trigger the objective -
        to cut off electricity. The second goal is to get the intel located
        inside the mansion.<br />
        - Two goals use same map, but in different scenes.<br />
        After deciding the core gameplay, I began sketching the level in 2D
        illustration which indicates the level layout and possible routes for
        players.

        2d layout

      <div class="main-design-description">
        During design phase I used Adobe Illustrator to block out the level and
        use some legends for the playable character, enemies and goal. I would
        like to make 2 major scenes in the game: the outdoor scene and the
        indoor scene. The first goal is set outside the mansion while the second
        goal needs the character to sneak into the mansion and stealth in a more
        constraint area.

        3d modelling
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        After having a layout sketch, I started prototyping and iterating the
        experience in third person perspective in a 3D environment with the help
        of the game engine.
        <br /><span class="element-title">translating</span><br />
        Putting 2D maps into a 3D world is not simply replacing lines with
        cubes. Given an additional space dimension, I need to think of how to
        translate the design faithfully and efficiently:<br />
        -Pay special attention to the height difference. Height difference would
        matter a lot in determining the visibility, and engaging enemies from a
        higher place is possible but is almost impossible from a lower place.<br />
        -Lines in 3D world have height and thickness. Wall is a key component in
        3D stealth games as it blocks sights and gives space for players to hide
        and ambush, so it plays a key role in game balance, and that's why the
        height and thickness is so important.<br />
        -Think in a dynamic point of view. Enemies have vision cones and as they
        move, they are observing different places. As I programmed the whole
        game system, there are way more details that needs careful thoughts.<br />
