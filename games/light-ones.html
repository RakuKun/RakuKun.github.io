        <div class="main-content-description">The story of Light Ones is really simple - you can almost say there is no traditional story inside. And there is almost no so-called interactions: all you need to do is keep the boy talking to the tree and listen to each's dialogues. I want to keep this game as simple as possible so I can focus on the dialogues and background settings. There is nothing impossible in a dream world - but do characters in the game really dream? They are merely the collection of codes, images and 3D models. So when designing this game I keep thinking of the idea "meta-game", a concept that is not strange to hear nowadays. And I want to explore and bring the possibilities of "meta" element.</div>

            I designed and modeled a 3D character for this game, he has no name so I would just call him "the boy". In order to make this game a bit more of fun, I designed animations for the boy so he can perform actions to show his feelings and emotions in the game.
