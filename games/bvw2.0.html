    <div class="top-introduction">
      Building Virtual Worlds is a class for the first semester of Master of
      Entertainment Technology Program during which I in a team of five take
      part as game designer and artist to make quick game prototypes. The
      process takes one to three weeks.

      <span class="element-title">asymmetrical role</span><br />
      One player drives the firetruck, another controls the water cannon. By
      assigning different abilities we make players stay connected to each
      other and communicate along the game.
      <br /><span class="element-title">unavoidable conflict</span><br /> It is supposed to be a fast paced game no
      longer than 2min each round. The battleground gets smaller as the game
      goes on, players will have to fight more intensely. Reasonable
      randomness. For competitive games people are expecting each round to be
      different (and the result as well). It’s not good to be 100% skill or
      100% luck, so adding a little randomness will help the game gets fun.
      The randomness must be well controlled to not overwhelm players’
      performance.
      <br /><span class="element-title">visual instructions</span><br /> Tell the players what will
      happen in game and make them understand the situation.

      Most players claim that driving is actually harder than
      spraying water. It is not a bad thing to have a diverse job difficulty
      inside a team, but we need to clarify it in the first place or players
      might get frustrated for underperforming.

      <span class="element-title">easy story with ups and downs</span><br /> It will be a 4min experience including
      interaction time so do not make the story too complicated. We go for a
      classroom romance since everyone probably has some experience on that.
      And we think adding a little surprise in story would help with the
      emotional flow.
      <br /><span class="element-title">meaningful interactions</span><br /> We learn from What Remains of Edith Finch
      combining interactions with story. We leave important moments waiting to
      be accomplished by player interaction so they feel being in the
      situation rather than watching a story sequence.

      <span class="element-title">deliver more clearly</span><br /> Some players have a hard time
      figuring out how the story and interaction is connected. And it is hard
      to have the same feeling as What Remains of Edith Finch as we are short
      on art and sound resources. So it might be better if we deliver the
      interaction in a clearer way with less metaphors.
      <br /><span class="element-title">do playtest as possible</span><br /> More playtesters help more in finding bugs
      and
      testing the interactions. If they don’t understand, that is probably we
      are making it too complicated.

      <span class="element-title">think of hardware</span><br />
      We are putting players into a very special game
      environment where they are surrounded by three large screens so they are
      like ‘inside’ the game world. This is an excellent chance for us to make
      a fully immersive game so we start the exploration concepting a Egytian
      pyramid where adventurers go and find treasures by solving puzzles.
      <br /><span class="element-title">flow experience</span><br />
      At the early stage the game merely
      consists of multiple puzzles with little transition between each other,
      which for most players could be tedious. I then suggested that we have
      pre-scripted animations between two puzzles so the experience will have
      its relaxed and intense part. That is also how we implement story into
      the actual game.
      <br /><span class="element-title">unified theme</span><br />
      At first we have
      many ideas about puzzles and they all seem to work in some way. But
      after several playtests we find that have just one unified theme for all
      puzzles will make it clearer for players and easier to control the
      difficulty for designers. We agreed on using ‘light’ as our core element
      as it is COOL and uses CAVE environment in a smart way. [PICTURE]

      <span class="element-title">playtests!</span><br /> We have some really nice
      puzzles and our environment really has Egyptian feeling, but that
      doesn’t work very well if the experience is way too long. We have a 9
      min playthrough which exceeds the 6 min expectation much. It turns out
      we still need more playtests as some players may need more time to
      understand and play with the mechanics.
