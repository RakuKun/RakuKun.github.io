        Building Virtual Worlds is a class for the first semester of Master of
        Entertainment Technology Program during which I in a team of five take
        part as game designer and artist to make quick game prototypes. The
        process takes one to three weeks.

        One player drives the firetruck, another controls the water cannon. By
        assigning different abilities we make players stay connected to each
        other and communicate along the game.
        <br /><span class="element-title">unavoidable conflict</span><br />
        It is supposed to be a fast paced game no longer than 2 minutes each
        round. The battleground gets smaller as the game goes on, players will
        have to fight more intensely. Reasonable randomness. For competitive
        games people are expecting each round to be different (and the result as
        well). It’s not good to be 100% skill or 100% luck, so adding a little
        randomness will help the game gets fun. The randomness must be well
        controlled to not overwhelm players’ performance. <br />

        Most players claim that driving is actually harder than spraying water.
        It is not a bad thing to have a diverse job difficulty inside a team,
        but we need to clarify it in the first place or players might get
        frustrated for underperforming.

        It will be a 4 minute experience including interaction time so do not
        make the story too complicated. We go for a classroom romance since
        everyone probably has some experience on that. And we think adding a
        little surprise in story would help with the emotional flow.
        <br /><span class="element-title">meaningful interactions</span><br />
        We learn from What Remains of Edith Finch combining interactions with
        story. We leave important moments waiting to be accomplished by player
        interaction so they feel being in the situation rather than watching a
        story sequence.

        <span class="element-title">deliver more clearly</span><br />
        Some players have a hard time figuring out how the story and interaction
        is connected. And it is hard to have the same feeling as What Remains of
        Edith Finch as we are short on art and sound resources. So it might be
        better if we deliver the interaction in a clearer way with less
        metaphors.
        <br /><span class="element-title">do playtest as possible</span><br />
        More playtesters help more in finding bugs and testing the interactions.
        If they don’t understand, that is probably we are making it too
        complicated.

        <span class="element-title">think of hardware</span><br />
        We are putting players into a very special game environment where they
        are surrounded by three large screens so they are like ‘inside’ the game
        world. This is an excellent chance for us to make a fully immersive game
        so we start the exploration finding concept for a Egyptian pyramid where
        adventurers go and find treasures by solving puzzles.
        <br /><span class="element-title">flow experience</span><br />
        At the early stage the game merely consists of multiple puzzles with
        little transition between each other, which for most players could be
        tedious. I then suggested that we have pre-scripted animations between
        two puzzles so the experience will have its relaxed and intense part.
        That is also how we implement story into the actual game.
        <br /><span class="element-title">unified theme</span><br />
        At first we have many ideas about puzzles and they all seem to work in
        some way. But after several playtests we find that have just one unified
        theme for all puzzles will make it clearer for players and easier to
        control the difficulty for designers. We decided on "light" as our core
        element as it is COOL and uses CAVE environment in a smart way.

      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">idea iteration</span><br />
        We begin with thinking some possible interesting mechanism that could
        utilize the specialty of CAVE, they are: light reflection and
        refraction, matching patterns, triggering with flashlight, and drawing.
        Our first playable prototype was a mixture of different kinds of puzzles
        but later we all agreed that "light reflection" is the most suitable
        mechanism.

        We have some really nice puzzles and our environment really has Egyptian
        feeling, but that doesn’t work very well if the experience is way too
        long. We have a 9 minute walkthrough which exceeds the expected 6
        minutes much. It turns out we still need more playtests as some players
        may need more time to understand and play with the mechanics.
