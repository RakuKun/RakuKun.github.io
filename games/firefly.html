        <div class="main-content-description">I got the conception of this game by thinking of a Chinese idiom "A flying moth darts into the fire" which means doing useless, even harmful things. I wonder if there is a way to let the player act as a small thing but act more meaningfully? So Firefly came out. <br>
            The player controls a firefly, that uses its light to guide one lost moth to find its way home. But the moth does not trust the firefly to some extent. According to the distance between the firefly, the moth acts in three different patterns:<br>
            If the firefly is too close, the moth gets threatened and tries to escape to a "safer" distance.<br>
            If the firefly is too far to see, the moth can easily lost its way and wander around aimlessly.<br>
            The moth will only be willing to follow firefly while the firefly is neither too close or too far from it. Even in such case, the moth tries to keep a distace and follow the track subsequently.<br>
            The difficulties of this game is that, the firefly needs to keep an approriate from the moth while ensuring both's safety. There are challenges everywhere: environment, predators and limited light source.

        <div class="main-content-title" id="experience">Experience</div>
        <div class="main-content-description">All games provide players with certain kind of experience. In firefly I want to do experiment with a dangerous adventure that awards nothing seemingly. The gameplay may offer some extent of incitation as player must avoid some danger, but in the end the failure is destined and no one will thank for guiding the moth. What will player feel and will they play this again? That is my question for the game.</div>
