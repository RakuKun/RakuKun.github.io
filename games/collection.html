        Game Collection is the showcase of some of the highly experimental or
        developing games. I like to make small prototypes to try some new
        mechanism, implement new art style or build some testing levels. Yet as
        most part of them are done by myself in a short time, they may appeal
        less polished. <br /><br />
        Also during the Global Game Jam in 2018 and 2019, two crazy games were
        created by my friends and me. They are done within 48 hours and are the
        proud representatives of my team's wildest ideas.

        The theme of GGJ 2018 is Transmit. We start thinking of the theme with
        several different approaches: transmit some information, some physical
        things (like waves), or some abstract concept in mankind civilization.
        Our final decision is to do a game about transmitting information
        throughout the history, so the first level is a soldier in Marathon
        carrying information for his country, the next scene is the travelling
        across the Great Wall, and the final scene is a modern scene on the
        topic of the internet and virus.
        <br /><span class="element-title">art style</span><br />
        We use comic style art for the game as it is fast to do in 2D and very
        expressive in platformers.<br />

        Another Way Out was built during GGJ 2019. It is a horizontal action RPG
        whose story is based on the contradictions between young Chinese people
        and old customs. In this game the protagonist wants to escape home where
        he has to deal with his parents and relatives in Chinese new year. They
        become giant bosses in the game, even with an eerie machine body. The
        player can only depend on powers and skills learned from game memes to
        defeat them and escape home! Check our GGJ

        The theme of GGJ 2019 is Home. It is a very familiar topic, yet to be
        honest, few of us really have really thought about how to convey home by
        a novel gameplay. Actually our team had a hard time deciding what the
        game would be like, and finally we settled down making a action
        platformer whose story reflects the phenomenon nowadays in many cities
        in China: younger people don't want to hang out with their elder
        relatives because the youth think traditional etiquette is out of
        fashion and meaningless. <br />
        We imagine that this conflict will develop into worse situations where
        two generations don't want to talk to each other. So we kind of put our
        thoughts in a wilder level by this game.
        <br /><span class="element-title">art style</span><br />
        Black and white mostly is cool. With some color we are able to emphasize
        on the attacks so the players could recognize boss's action easily.

        The rule of Chrono Bathhouse is quite simple - to earn as much as you
        can in the restricted time. Slimes and Terracotta are the customers in
        this world and they appear and acts differently. I intended to add more
        diverse customers but that would take some more time.
        <br /><span class="element-title">art</span><br />
        The 2D Art below shows the art style of this game. I tried to draw NPCs
        in a cuter way - making them appealing to the players as much as I can.
        The work is mainly about drawing different washing animations for each
        type of customers in each facility. Thankfully two kinds of slimes only
        differ in color, so I only need to draw one group of animations then
        change color style. <br />

        The story of Light Ones is really simple - you can almost say there is
        no traditional story inside. And there is almost no so-called
        interactions: all you need to do is keep the boy talking to the tree and
        listen to each dialogues. I want to keep this game as simple as possible
        so I can focus on the dialogues and background settings. There is
        nothing impossible in a dream world - but do characters in the game
        really dream? They are merely the collection of codes, images and 3D
        models. So when designing this game I keep thinking of the idea
        "meta-game", a concept that is not strange to hear nowadays. And I want
        to explore and bring the possibilities of "meta" element.
        <br /><span class="element-title">art style</span><br />
        All the art resources except skybox related are made on my own, of which
        I have spent most time working on is the character. He has no name so I
        would just call him "the boy". When shaping and rigging the boy I
        referred to the boy in game <i>Inside</i>. In order to make this game a
        bit more of fun, I designed animations for the boy so he can perform
        actions to show his feelings and emotions in the game. All the 3D and
        animation work is done in blender.<br />
        As for the art style of the whole game, I chose low poly with some
        ambient bloom so the work is easier but still has acceptable looking (at
        least I think so!).

        <span class="element-title">ideation</span><br />
        I got the conception of this game by thinking of a Chinese idiom "A
        flying moth darts into the fire" which sacrifice oneself for meaningless
        purposes. I wonder if there is a way to let the player act as a small
        thing but act more meaningfully? So came out Firefly.
        <br /><span class="element-title">interaction</span><br />
        The player controls a firefly that uses its light to guide a lost moth
        to find its way home. But the moth does not trust the firefly to some
        extent. According to the distance between the firefly, the moth acts in
        three different patterns:<br />
        · If the firefly is too close, the moth gets threatened and tries to
        escape to a "safer" distance.<br />
        · If the firefly is too far to see, the moth can easily lost its way and
        wander around aimlessly.<br />
        · The moth will only be willing to follow firefly while the firefly is
        neither too close or too far from it. Even in such case, the moth tries
        to keep a distance and follow the track subsequently.<br />
        The difficulties of this game is that, the firefly needs to keep an
        appropriate from the moth while ensuring both safety. There are
        challenges everywhere: environment, predators and limited light source.
        <br /><span class="element-title">experience</span><br />
        All games provide players with certain kind of experience. In firefly I
        want to do experiment with a dangerous adventure that awards nothing
        seemingly. The gameplay may offer some extent of incitation as player
        must avoid some danger, but in the end the failure is destined and no
        one will thank for guiding the moth. What will player feel and will they
        play this again? That is my question for the game.
