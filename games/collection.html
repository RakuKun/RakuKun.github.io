        Small Game Collection is the showcase of some of my games that are still
        under development or are experimental. I like to make small prototypes
        to try some new mechanism or implement new art style or build some
        testing levels. Yet as most part of them are done by myself in a short
        time, they may appeal less polished.I like to make small prototypes to

        The rule of Chrono Bathhouse is quite simple - to earn as much as you
        can in the restricted time. Slimes and Terracotta are the customers in
        this world and they appear and acts differently. I intended to add more
        diverse customers but that would take some more time.
        <br /><span class="element-title">art</span><br />
        The 2D Art below shows the art style of this game. I tried to draw NPCs
        in a cuter way - making them appealing to the players as much as I can.
        The work is mainly about drawing different washing animations for each
        type of customers in each facility. Thankfully two kinds of slimes only
        differ in color, so I only need to draw one group of animations then
        change color style. <br />

        The story of Light Ones is really simple - you can almost say there is
        no traditional story inside. And there is almost no so-called
        interactions: all you need to do is keep the boy talking to the tree and
        listen to each dialogues. I want to keep this game as simple as possible
        so I can focus on the dialogues and background settings. There is
        nothing impossible in a dream world - but do characters in the game
        really dream? They are merely the collection of codes, images and 3D
        models. So when designing this game I keep thinking of the idea
        "meta-game", a concept that is not strange to hear nowadays. And I want
        to explore and bring the possibilities of "meta" element.
        <br /><span class="element-title">art style</span><br />
        All the art resources except skybox related are made on my own, of which
        I have spent most time working on is the character. He has no name so I
        would just call him "the boy". When shaping and rigging the boy I
        referred to the boy in game <i>Inside</i>. In order to make this game a
        bit more of fun, I designed animations for the boy so he can perform
        actions to show his feelings and emotions in the game. All the 3D and
        animation work is done in blender.<br />
        As for the art style of the whole game, I chose low poly with some
        ambient bloom so the work is easier but still has acceptable looking (at
        least I think so!).

        I got the conception of this game by thinking of a Chinese idiom "A
        flying moth darts into the fire" which means doing useless, even harmful
        things. I wonder if there is a way to let the player act as a small
        thing but act more meaningfully? So Firefly came out.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/games/collection/firefly-1.png" />
        </div>
        <br /><span class="element-title">interaction</span><br />
        The player controls a firefly that uses its light to guide a lost moth
        to find its way home. But the moth does not trust the firefly to some
        extent. According to the distance between the firefly, the moth acts in
        three different patterns:<br />
        · If the firefly is too close, the moth gets threatened and tries to
        escape to a "safer" distance.<br />
        · If the firefly is too far to see, the moth can easily lost its way and
        wander around aimlessly.<br />
        · The moth will only be willing to follow firefly while the firefly is
        neither too close or too far from it. Even in such case, the moth tries
        to keep a distance and follow the track subsequently.<br />
        The difficulties of this game is that, the firefly needs to keep an
        appropriate from the moth while ensuring both safety. There are
        challenges everywhere: environment, predators and limited light source.
        <br /><span class="element-title">experience</span><br />
        All games provide players with certain kind of experience. In firefly I
        want to do experiment with a dangerous adventure that awards nothing
        seemingly. The gameplay may offer some extent of incitation as player
        must avoid some danger, but in the end the failure is destined and no
        one will thank for guiding the moth. What will player feel and will they
        play this again? That is my question for the game.
