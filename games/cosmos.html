      <div class="main-description" style="width: 100%;">
        Stone teaches his Game Design Fundamentals class in a way both
        theoretical and practical. There is quite a few theories I learn from
        his lecture and I consider them very as important game design principles
        as they work for basically all kinds of games (board game or digital
        game).

        game elements
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        All good games have something in common without which the game just
        breaks or is not as fun. These are basic elements.
        <br /><span class="element-title">goals</span><br />
        A game cannot run without goals. The ultimate reason to have a goal is
        that nobody wants to waste time doing something confused without an end.
        Also, a goal helps define when the game should end, and how should
        players reach the goal.
        <br /><span class="element-title">start</span><br />
        Start is where and how players begin a game. All games have start
        naturally, but start is also a key component of game as an imbalanced
        start might ruin the experience. And start controls the "distance"
        between itself and the goal, which also needs good tweaking for the good
        game flow.
        <br /><span class="element-title">obstacle</span><br />
        Obstacle defines the challenge part which separates game design from
        experience design. A game should always be challenging in some ways to
        ask players to spend time either thinking or executing, while an
        experience does not need to. A good obstacle could be a well controlled
        balance between "skill" factor and "luck" factor.
        <br /><span class="element-title">rules</span><br />
        Rules control how a game goes, and basically it is the wide collection
        of all the interactive parts: how game response to a decision? What and
        how can players do to each other? How should the game end? These
        questions should all be answered in rules.

      <div class="main-description" style="width: 100%;">
        Since I am a big fan of Slay the Spire, I decide to make a competitive
        deck-building game. I start my design by studying some board games of
        the same genre. Learning from those titles, I am able to construct the
        basic framework of my board game.

        <span class="element-title">Slay the Spire</span><br />
        Slay the Spire is a deck-building roguelike made by Mega Crit. A single
        player game, Slay the Spire features procedurally generated maps and
        semi-randomly dropped cards and power-ups as the base of its
        replayability. Its four predetermined characters can their unique deck
        inspires me of how to create card synergy and balance cards: to create a
        standard mathematical model for the cost and effect, then add more
        uncertainty and variety.
        <br /><span class="element-title">Star Realms</span><br />
        Star Realms is a deck-building board game pitting players against each
        other in a fight for dominance over the entire galaxy. As a multiplayer
        card game with four Factions (camps), Star Realms does a good job
        designing the deck-building mechanism in offering a shared trade row
        which is fair for both sides. In this fast paced game the deck grows
        stronger in a significant quick way, so learning to balance the early
        game and late game is also a lesson for me.

        A star in a faraway galaxy is to explode in supernova soon, which will
        kill every living thing in its range. Three civilizations begin the
        exodus: <br />
        red civilization are aggressive and always want to wipe out other
        civilization in the galaxy; <br />
        yellow civilization are successful colonizing and work closely among
        multiple stars;<br />
        blue civilization never lack scientists and philosophers because they
        are so eager to learn new knowledge. <br />
        <span class="element-title">basic structure</span><br />
        COSMOS is a 1v1v1 deck-building turn-bases card game, but different from
        most games where everyone has "health" and needs to decrease other
        player's health, in this game each player takes turns to get and play
        cards to get to the destination on the map.
        <br /><span class="element-title">game components</span><br />
        The cards are in 3 colors: blue, red and yellow, each standing for one
        civilization. Each civilization has their unique cards that suits its
        backstory. Each player has a Mothership which needs to be carried to the
        destination. There are 3 basic collections of ships:<br />
        Explorers: The collection of ships mainly for getting resources on the
        map.<br />
        Fighters: The collection of ships mainly for deteriorating the power of
        other camps, for instance, move their Motherships back or destroy
        ships.<br />
        Boosters: The collection of ships mainly for moving Mothership. Below is
        the first draft of the game map. The map is divided into many blocks,
        and all players have the same start point and destination while each
        other block has a number in it which means the resources.

        Prototype Alpha Version
      </div>
      <div class="main-description">
        Iteration is absolutely a key faction in game design, and even more
        crucial for board games as it's not hard to make prototypes but I do
        need to confirm that if the game has a good flow and make players fully
        engaged. During the course I will have 2 classes dedicated for
        playtesting and I also hold off-class playtests with individuals. I keep
        a record of what I did well and what should improve from each
        playtester's opinion.<br />
        For version alpha I mainly want to test the core gameplay and the fun
        factor in multiplayer competition. I started off by only having two
        camps for this version since balancing three camps could cost lots of
        extra work. Each card also had a minimal illustration.

        gameplay
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">cards</span>
        There are two kinds of units: Ships are ones that can move by itself
        (usually determined by a 6-sided die), and Boosters are ones attached to
        the Mothership but can make the Mothership move.<br />
        Some ships can gain money from the map (indicated by the numbers in
        blocks) and buy new units from a shared trade list.

        </div>
        <span class="element-title">map</span><br />
        The first version is a 1v1 game with a map where each player owns a
        Mothership that needs to be moved from the start point to the
        destination. The map has 50 blocks so in most circumstances the
        Mothership needs to move 50 blocks.<br />

        problems
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        The first prototype only has two camps and a relatively limited number
        of cards, despite of which I still managed to figure out a bunch of
        problems on balance, game feeling and map.<br />
        Balance: It turns out some cards are OP while some are almost useless.
        Balancing cards is simple as the major work is tweaking the value of
        each card. But when it comes related to feeling and pace, changing card
        becomes much harder.<br />
        Game feeling: I put card's synergy and their unique abilities on high
        priority. During playtest, some says they really like the creative
        design of cards, but other also say that it is hard to understand the
        rules and playing too many cards in a single turn takes time and energy.
        It is especially true in late games as the rules allow triggering every
        ability in a single turn which can cause chaos and difficulty. <br />
        Pace: The game feels too slow but once someone gets a key card it can
        get ridiculously fast. Evidently some cards are OP.

        next step
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        Think of the map and card: I can either narrow the map or buff basic
        cards.<br />
        Make a rulebook so I don’t recall rules.<br />
        Make a REALLY BIG (and fancy) map.<br />
        Design more cards and do 1v1v1 version playtests, if it turns out three
        people are too messy, just make it a 1v1 game.<br />
        Clearly differentiate active skills, passive skills and limited skills
        so they are triggered in right time and right order.<br />
        Buff or nerf some cards but pay more to more attention to card synergy.

        Prototype Beta Version

        <span class="element-title">card types</span><br />
        I want to clarify card's types so as to balance some card's abilities
        and make it feel more natural because there are basically two types of
        movement on the map, the first being ships that can move by themselves,
        and the second are boosters attached to the Mothership and move with it.

          >Red Camp</span
        ><br />
        Keyword: Glory, Sacrifice<br />
        Red camp is warlike. Many red units can apply negative effects on the
        opponent’s units to fuel the battle.<br />
        Sacrifice: Some units can sacrifice itself for the greater merit.<br />

          >Blue Camp</span
        ><br />
        Keyword: Synergy, Control<br />
        Blue camp puts order at a very important place, so they have strong card
        synergy that can control the battlefield and change the battle.<br />
        Control: Disable target ship’s abilities.<br />

          >Yellow Camp</span
        ><br />
        Keyword: Evolution, Telekinesis<br />
        The yellow camp is more into physiological and personal evolution. Their
        cards are mostly expensive, but with very unique abilities such as
        telekinesis that can teleport Mothership, Yellow camp has the highest
        flexibility in late game and could dominate the game once its galactic
        fleet are running on the map.<br />
        Telekinesis: Move target ship or Mothership instantly to a target
        location.
        <br /><span class="element-title">card balance</span><br />
        Balancing has been a major problem for many card games and especially
        deck-building games. Since the alpha version is pretty rough with almost
        no testing, I want to try establishing a mathematical model for cards'
        costs, values and special abilities so I can stick to the pattern and
        avoid making big mistakes.
