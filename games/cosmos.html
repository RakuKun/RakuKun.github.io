        COSMOS is a board game I am working on as the course project for Stone
        Librande's Game Design Fundamentals class. In general, this is a 1v1v1
        deck building game with three different camps and unique cards for each.

      <div class="main-introduction">
        Stone teaches his Game Design Fundamentals class in a theoretical but
        also practical way. There is quite a few theories I learn from his
        lecture and I consider them very important game design principles as
        they work for basically all kinds of games (board game or digital game).

        game's elements
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        All good games have something in common without which the game just
        breaks or not as fun. I call them basic elements.
        <br /><span class="element-title">goals</span><br />
        A game cannot run without goals. The ultimate reason to have a goal is
        that nobody wants to waste time doing something confused without an end.
        Also, a goal helps define when the game should end, and how should
        players reach the goal.
        <br /><span class="element-title">start</span><br />
        Start is where and how players begin a game. All games have start
        naturally, but start is also a key component of game as an imbalanced
        start might ruin the experience. And start controls the "distance"
        between itself and the goal, which also needs good tweaking for the good
        game flow.
        <br /><span class="element-title">obstacle</span><br />
        Obstacle defines the challenge part which separates game design from
        experience design. A game should always be challenging in some ways to
        ask players to spend time either thinking or executing, while an
        experience does not need to. A good obstacle could be a well controlled
        balance between "skill" factor and "luck" factor.
        <span class="element-title">rules</span><br />
        Rules control how a game goes, and basically it is the wide collection
        of all the interactive parts: how game response to a decision? What and
        how can players do to each other? How should the game end? These
        questions should all be answered in rules.

          Since I am a big fan of Slay the Spire, I start my design by studying
          some board games of the same genre. Learning from those titles, I am
          able to construct the basic framework of my board game.
