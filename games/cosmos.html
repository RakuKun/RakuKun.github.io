        Before the 1/4 walkaround we spent about three weeks doing research and
        thinking of new ideas. As State Share is a relatively new function
        exclusively developed for Stadia and with little reference or tech demo
        so far, we start off thinking the special points of State Share and how
        can it contribute to the game design and community.<br /><br />
        Oh! That's me happily working in the team!

        <span class="element-title">special points</span><br />
        Before thinking how we build games based on State Share, we agreed that
        it is very important to determine the advantage of Google Stadia and
        especially State Share that we are working on. After reading the posts
        on developer website we concluded some merits that differentiate State
        Share with traditional online or local multiplayer network.<br />
        1. State Share works well with Youtube streaming as it posts a link in
        the chat and audience can jump into the game simply by clicking the
        link. This enables new ways for streamers to interact with their
        audience. <br />
        2. State Share will record last 30s video before creating the link, and
        all information during that time will be included in the link. The
        developers have much freedom to decide which and how the information is
        to be used.<br />
        3. State Share will work with other Stadia features such as Crowd Play
        and Stadia Team is working to bring more flexibility to its function. In
        that sense, we as developers would concentrate on finding a well
        structured gameplay that manipulates State Share as its core mechanics.
        <br /><span class="element-title">possible usage</span><br />
        After internal and client meetings we concluded 10 possible ways to use
        State Share.
