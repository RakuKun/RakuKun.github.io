        Stone teaches his Game Design Fundamentals class in a theoretical but
        also practical way. There is quite a few theories I learn from his
        lecture and I consider them very important game design principles as
        they work for basically all kinds of games (board game or digital game).

        Before thinking how we build games based on State Share, we agreed that
        it is very important to determine the advantage of Google Stadia and
        especially State Share that we are working on. After reading the posts
        on developer website we concluded some merits that differentiate State
        Share with traditional online or local multiplayer network.<br />
        1. State Share works well with Youtube streaming as it posts a link in
        the chat and audience can jump into the game simply by clicking the
        link. This enables new ways for streamers to interact with their
        audience. <br />
        2. State Share will record last 30s video before creating the link, and
        all information during that time will be included in the link. The
        developers have much freedom to decide which and how the information is
        to be used.<br />
        3. State Share will work with other Stadia features such as Crowd Play
        and Stadia Team is working to bring more flexibility to its function. In
        that sense, we as developers would concentrate on finding a well
        structured gameplay that manipulates State Share as its core mechanics.
