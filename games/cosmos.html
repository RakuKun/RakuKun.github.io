        Cosmos is a board game I worked on for the course project for Stone
        Librande's Game Design Fundamentals. It is an 1v1v1 resource management
        game where players compete to be the first person to obtain the winning
        score.

        I initially decided to try making a competitive deck-building game. I
        started the ideation phase by studying similar games that have proven
        commercially and critically successful. After that, I outlined some of
        the key elements that I would love to implement in my own game.

        Slay the Spire is a deck-building roguelike made by Mega Crit. A single
        player game, Slay the Spire features four playable characters, each of
        whom has their unique deck where many examples can be found for learning
        card synergy and balancing. What's more, Slay the Spire also does a good
        job in balancing the skill and luck factor using procedurally generated
        maps and semi-randomly dropped cards and power-ups as the base of its
        replayability. There's the link to my detailed analysis of the game:

        Star Realms is a deck-building board game pitting players against each
        other in a fight for dominance over the entire galaxy. A multiplayer
        card game with four Factions (camps), Star Realms does a good job
        designing the deck-building mechanism by offering a shared trade row,
        fair enough for both sides. The game uses a very straight forward way to
        make sure players pick the cards of same Faction: the powerful Ally
        ability can only be triggered if the player have another card of that
        faction in-play.

        <span class="element-title">backstory</span><br />
        A star in a faraway galaxy is to explode in supernova soon, which will
        kill every living thing in its range. Three civilizations embark on the
        great exodus: <br />
        Red civilization is aggressive and always wants to wipe out other
        civilization in the galaxy; <br />
        Yellow civilization is successful colonizing and works closely among
        multiple stars; <br />
        Blue civilization never lacks scientists and philosophers because they
        are so eager to learn new knowledge. <br />
        <span class="element-title">gameplay overview</span><br />
        Cosmos is a 1v1v1 turn-based deck-building card game where each player
        tries to move their mothership to the destination point on the map. The
        game offers ways to move your own mothership and also to impede other
        motherships' moving process. The ship's movement is similar to the
        health in many competitive games, but with real blocks on the map more
        gameplay tricks can be designed.
        <br /><span class="element-title">game components</span><br />
        The game uses cards and tokens. <br /><br />
        The cards are in 3 colors: blue, red and yellow, each standing for one
        civilization. Each civilization has their unique cards that suits its
        background. Each player has a Mothership which needs to move to the
        destination to win. There are three basic collections of ships:<br />
        Explorers: The units mainly for getting resources on the map.<br />
        Fighters: The units that have diverse abilities from boosting own camp's
        mothership to impeding other camps, for instance, moving their
        Motherships back or destroying ships.<br />
        Boosters: The units that mainly move the Mothership. <br /><br />
        Tokens will be put on the map to represent all the units and
        Motherships.

      <div class="main-title">Prototyping</div>
      <div class="main-description">
        Iteration is absolutely a key faction in game design, and even more
        crucial for board games as it's not hard to make prototypes but I do
        need to confirm that if the game has a good flow and make players fully
        engaged. During the course I will have 2 classes dedicated for
        playtesting and I also hold off-class playtests with individuals. I keep
        a record of what I did well and what should improve from each
        playtester's opinion.<br />
        For this beta version I mainly wanted to test the core gameplay and the
        fun factor in multiplayer competition. I started off by only having two
        camps for this version since balancing three camps could cost lots of
        extra work. Each card also had a minimal illustration.

        Gameplay
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">cards</span><br />
        There are two kinds of units: Ships are ones that can move by itself
        (usually determined by a 6-sided die), and Boosters are ones attached to
        the Mothership but can make the Mothership move.<br />
        Some ships can gain money from the map (indicated by the numbers in
        blocks) and buy new units from a shared trade list.
        <div class="element-image">

        </div>
        <span class="element-title">map</span><br />
        The first version is a 1v1 game with a map where each player owns a
        Mothership that needs to be moved from the start point to the
        destination. The map has 50 blocks so in most circumstances the
        Mothership needs to move 50 blocks.<br />

        Problems
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        The first prototype only has two camps and a relatively limited number
        of cards, despite of which I still managed to figure out a bunch of
        problems on balance, game feeling and map.<br />
        Balance: It turns out some cards are OP while some are almost useless.
        Balancing cards is simple as the major work is tweaking the value of
        each card. But when it comes related to feeling and pace, changing card
        becomes much harder.<br />
        Game feeling: I put card's synergy and their unique abilities on high
        priority. During playtest, some says they really like the creative
        design of cards, but other also say that it is hard to understand the
        rules and playing too many cards in a single turn takes time and energy.
        It is especially true in late games as the rules allow triggering every
        ability in a single turn which can cause chaos and difficulty. <br />
        Pace: The game feels too slow but once someone gets a key card it can
        get ridiculously fast. Evidently some cards are OP.

        Next Step
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        Think of the map and card: I can either narrow the map or buff basic
        cards.<br />
        Make a rulebook so I don’t recall rules.<br />
        Make a REALLY BIG (and fancy) map.<br />
        Design more cards and do 1v1v1 version playtests, if it turns out three
        people are too messy, just make it a 1v1 game.<br />
        Clearly differentiate active skills, passive skills and limited skills
        so they are triggered in right time and right order.<br />
        Buff or nerf some cards but pay more to more attention to card synergy.

        Cards
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">card types</span><br />
        I want to clarify card's types so as to balance some card's abilities
        and make it feel more natural because there are basically two types of
        movement on the map, the first being ships that can move by themselves,
        and the second are boosters attached to the Mothership and move with it.

        Camps

      <div class="main-design-description">
        In beta version I concluded three camps' keywords and used them as the
        principle for designing cards.

          >Red Camp</span
        ><br />
        Keyword: Glory, Sacrifice<br />
        Red camp is warlike. Many red units can apply negative effects on the
        opponent’s units to fuel the battle.<br />
        Sacrifice: Some units can sacrifice itself for the greater merit.<br />

          >Blue Camp</span
        ><br />
        Keyword: Synergy, Control<br />
        Blue camp puts order at a very important place, so they have strong card
        synergy that can control the battlefield and change the battle.<br />
        Control: Disable target ship’s abilities.<br />

          "
          >Yellow Camp</span
        ><br />
        Keyword: Evolution, Telekinesis<br />
        The yellow camp is more into physiological and personal evolution. Their
        cards are mostly expensive, but with very unique abilities such as
        telekinesis that can teleport Mothership, Yellow camp has the highest
        flexibility in late game and could dominate the game once its galactic
        fleet arrives.<br />
        Telekinesis: Move target ship or Mothership instantly to a target
        location.
        <br /><span class="element-title">card balance</span><br />
        Balancing has been a major problem for many card games and especially
        deck-building games. Since the beta version is pretty rough with almost
        no testing, I want to try establishing a mathematical model for cards'
        costs, values and special abilities so I can stick to the pattern and
        avoid making big mistakes.

      <div class="main-title">Product</div>
      <div class="main-description">
        With the takeaways gained from the beta version, I decided to design a
        beta version with a different core mechanism.

        A Tough Pivoting
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        The main reason for the pivoting was the balancing issue and the
        workload of a deck-building game that went beyond my estimation. Despite
        many cool ideas that came up to my mind, I realize that the game I was
        building was still far from well-rounded and I had to spent a lot of
        time to tweak the value.<br /><br />
        So I decided to make a simplified game with the space theme kept. I was
        thinking of a resource management game then because I as well had rich
        experiences playing some typical resource management game such as Catan
        and Splendor.

        Top-down Design

      <div class="main-design-description">
        I still wanted to keep the competitive gameplay and wanted to use an
        1v1v1 mechanism to trigger some interesting interactions between
        players, because 1v1v1 is usually not an "equal" situation as two weaker
        players could ally up against the strongest player. After a month's
        playtesting and iterating, I finally settled down upon the final
        playable version. Here's the
