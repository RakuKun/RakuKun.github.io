      <div class="top-introduction">
        During the Global Game Jam in year 2018 and 2019, two crazy games were
        created by my friends and me. They are in no ways well polished but
        somewhat are representative of our wildest ideas.

        Dramatic successor is a 2D action game where player acts as the
        successors of information in 3 eras. Different successors have different
        goals and abilities. It is designed for giving a brief understanding of
        the history of media's development.

        The rule of Chrono Bathhouse is quite simple - to earn as much as you
        can in the restricted time. Slimes and Terracotta are the customers in
        this world and they appear and acts differently. I intended to add more
        diverse customers but that would take some more time.

        The 2D Art below shows the art style of this game. I tried to draw NPCs
        in a cuter way - making them appealing to the players as much as I can.
        The work is mainly about drawing different washing animations for each
        type of customers in each facility. Thankfully two kinds of slimes only
        differ in color, so I only need to draw one group of animations then
        change color style. <br />

      <div class="main-introduction">
        Another Way Out is a horizontal action RPG based on the contradictions
        between young Chinese people and old customs. In this game the
        protagonist wants to escape home where he has to deal with his parents
        and relatives in Chinese new year. They become giant bosses in the game,
        even with an eerie machine body. The player can only depend on powers
        and skills learned from game memes to defeat them and escape home!

        The story of Light Ones is really simple - you can almost say there is
        no traditional story inside. And there is almost no so-called
        interactions: all you need to do is keep the boy talking to the tree and
        listen to each dialogues. I want to keep this game as simple as possible
        so I can focus on the dialogues and background settings. There is
        nothing impossible in a dream world - but do characters in the game
        really dream? They are merely the collection of codes, images and 3D
        models. So when designing this game I keep thinking of the idea
        "meta-game", a concept that is not strange to hear nowadays. And I want
        to explore and bring the possibilities of "meta" element.
        <br /><span class="element-title">art style</span><br />
        All the art resources except skybox related are made on my own, of which
        I have spent most time working on is the character. He has no name so I
        would just call him "the boy". When shaping and rigging the boy I
        referred to the boy in game <i>Inside</i>. In order to make this game a
        bit more of fun, I designed animations for the boy so he can perform
        actions to show his feelings and emotions in the game. All the 3D and
        animation work is done in blender.<br />
        As for the art style of the whole game, I chose low poly with some
        ambient bloom so the work is easier but still has acceptable looking (at
        least I think so!).
