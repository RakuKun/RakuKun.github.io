      <div class="top-introduction">
        During the Global Game Jam in year 2018 and 2019, two crazy games were
        created by my friends and me. They are in no ways well polished but
        somewhat are representative of our wildest ideas.

        Dramatic successor is a 2D action game where player acts as the
        successors of information in 3 eras. Different successors have different
        goals and abilities. It is designed for giving a brief understanding of
        the history of media's development.

        The theme of GGJ 2018 is Transmit. We start thinking of the theme with
        several different approaches: transmit some information, some physical
        things (like waves), or some abstract concept in mankind civilization.
        Our final decision is to do a game about transmitting information
        throughout the history, so the first level is a soldier in Marathon
        carrying information for his country, the next scene is the travelling
        across the Great Wall, and the final scene is a modern scene on the
        topic of the internet and virus.
        <br /><span class="element-title">art</span><br />
        We use comic style art for the game as it is fast to do in 2D and very
        expressive in platformers.<br />

      <div class="main-introduction">
        Another Way Out is a horizontal action RPG based on the contradictions
        between young Chinese people and old customs. In this game the
        protagonist wants to escape home where he has to deal with his parents
        and relatives in Chinese new year. They become giant bosses in the game,
        even with an eerie machine body. The player can only depend on powers
        and skills learned from game memes to defeat them and escape home!

        The theme of GGJ 2019 is Home. It is a very familiar topic, yet to be
        honest, few of us really have really thought about how to convey home by
        a novel gameplay. Actually our team had a hard time deciding what the
        game would be like, and finally we settled down making a action
        platformer whose story reflects the phenomenon nowadays in many cities
        in China: younger people don't want to hang out with their elder
        relatives because the youth think traditional etiquette is out of
        fashion and meaningless. <br />
        We imagine that this conflict will develop into worse situations where
        two generations don't want to talk to each other. So we kind of put our
        thoughts in a wilder level by this game.
        <br /><span class="element-title">art style</span><br />
        Black and white mostly is cool. With some color we are able to emphasize
        on the attacks so the players could recognize boss's action easily.
