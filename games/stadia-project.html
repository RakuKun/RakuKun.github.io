      <div class="top-introduction" style="color: var(--ro); font-weight: 500;">
        In March 2019 Google Stadia announced a platform exclusive feature
        called State Share. This technology leverages cloud game hosting to
        enable players to share a complete game state (not just a specified save
        state) instantly to their friends or to the public. This project
        explores the affordances of this technology specifically for the
        discovery of new kinds of game design patterns and new game genres that
        are inherently viral and require elaborate player cooperation across
        massive scale audiences.
        <br />I work in a team of five at Entertainment Technology Center
        Silicon Valley. The project is still under development and more content
        will be added on a quite regular basis.

        Before the 1/4 walkaround we spent about three weeks doing research and
        thinking of new ideas. As State Share is a relatively new function
        exclusively developed for Stadia and with little reference or tech demo
        by far, we start off thinking the special points of State Share and how
        can it contribute to the game design and community.

        <span class="element-title">special points</span><br />
        Before thinking how we build games based on State Share, we agreed that
        it is very important to determine the advantage of Google Stadia and
        especially State Share that we are working on. After reading the posts
        on developer website
        <span class="important">
          <a
            onclick="transitionToPage('https:/stadia.dev/intl/en_us/blog/','var(--shironeri)')"
            >HERE,</a
          >
        </span>
        we concluded some merits that diffeciate State Share with traditional
        online or local multiplayer network.<br />
        1. State Share works well with Youtube streaming as it posts a link in
        the chat and audience can jump into the game simply by clicking the
        link. This enables new ways for streamers to interact with their
        audience. 2. State Share will record last 30s video before creating the
        link, and all information during that time will be included in the link.
        The developers have much freedom to decide which and how the information
        is to be used. 3. State Share will work with other Stadia features such
        as Crowd Play and Stadia Team is working to bring more flexibility to
        its function. In that sense, we as developers would concentrate on
        finding a well structured gameplay that manuplates State Share as its
        core mechanics.
        <br /><span class="element-title">possible usage</span><br />
        After internal and client meetings we concluded 10 possible ways to use
        State Share.

      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">narrowing down</span><br />
        Starting from week 3, we decided to narrow down ideas by eliminating
        those unpractical or not using State Share as a important mechanism. And
        this time we got 5 more concrete ideas that are ready for prototyping.
        <span class="element-title">paper prototype</span><br />
        We use paper prototypes for the 5 ideas as designing on paper is easier
        technically and expose the core mechanics well.
