        In March 2019 Google Stadia announced a platform exclusive feature
        called State Share. This technology leverages cloud game hosting to
        enable players to share a complete game state (not just a specified save
        state) instantly to their friends or to the public. This project
        explores the possibility of this technology specifically for the
        discovery of new kinds of game design patterns and new game genres that
        are inherently viral and require elaborate player cooperation across
        massive scale audiences.
        <br /><br />I work in a team of five at Entertainment Technology Center
        Silicon Valley. The project is still under development and more content
        will be added on a quite regular basis. <br /><br />The project website,
        which is hosted by the ETC, could be found
        <span class="important"
          ><a href="https://www.etc.cmu.edu/projects/ditto/">HERE.</a></span
        >The website is planned to post new blogs and findings every week.

        Before the 1/4 walkaround we spent about three weeks doing research and
        thinking of new ideas. As State Share is a relatively new function
        exclusively developed for Stadia and with little reference or tech demo
        so far, we start off thinking the special points of State Share and how
        can it contribute to the game design and community.

        <span class="element-title">special points</span><br />
        Before thinking how we build games based on State Share, we agreed that
        it is very important to determine the advantage of Google Stadia and
        especially State Share that we are working on. After reading the posts
        on developer website
        <span class="important">
          <a
            onclick="transitionToPage('https:/stadia.dev/intl/en_us/blog/','var(--shironeri)')"
            >HERE,</a
          >
        </span>
        we concluded some merits that differentiate State Share with traditional
        online or local multiplayer network.<br />
        1. State Share works well with Youtube streaming as it posts a link in
        the chat and audience can jump into the game simply by clicking the
        link. This enables new ways for streamers to interact with their
        audience. <br />
        2. State Share will record last 30s video before creating the link, and
        all information during that time will be included in the link. The
        developers have much freedom to decide which and how the information is
        to be used.<br />
        3. State Share will work with other Stadia features such as Crowd Play
        and Stadia Team is working to bring more flexibility to its function. In
        that sense, we as developers would concentrate on finding a well
        structured gameplay that manipulates State Share as its core mechanics.
        <br /><span class="element-title">possible usage</span><br />
        After internal and client meetings we concluded 10 possible ways to use
        State Share.
        <div class="element-image">
          <img src="/media/games/stadia/stadia-1.jpg" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-title">
        <hr />
        prototype
      </div>
      <div class="main-design-description">
        <span class="element-title">specification</span><br />
        Starting from week 3, we decided to narrow down ideas by eliminating
        those unpractical or not using State Share as a important mechanism. And
        this time we got 5 more concrete ideas that are ready for
        prototyping.<br />
        <span class="element-title">paper prototype</span><br />
        We use paper prototypes for the 5 ideas as designing on paper is easier
        technically and expose the core mechanics well. The one I designed
        explores the concept of "delivering the state".
        <div class="element-image-flex">
          <img src="/media/games/stadia/stadia-2.jpg" />
          <img src="/media/games/stadia/stadia-3.jpg" />
        </div>
        It is also very important to run playtests as many as possible. For
        paper prototypes we have run 3 rounds of playtests, the first and second
        being internal testing, and the third time we invited some EA employees
        whose experience is very valuable to improve our design. Here are some
        suggestions from our playtesters: <br />
        1. Think of State Share as a core feature without which the gameplay
        would change a lot. <br />
        2. Be careful about the theme: is the fiction suitable for all ages?
        Will the game mechanism ask for some private information such as living
        location? <br />
        3. Online multiplayer games are challenging but seems more promising,
        while unsynchronized gameplay is easier to do digital prototypes.<br />
        Now since we have the quarter walkaround, we are stepping into the
        digital prototyping phase.<br />
        <span class="element-title">digital prototype</span><br />
        Starting from week 5 (March 9) the team will work on making one digital
        prototype.
