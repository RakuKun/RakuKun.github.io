            Building Virtual Worlds is a class for the first semester of Master of Entertainment Technology Program
            during
            which I in a team of five take part as game designer and artist to make quick game prototypes. The process
            takes
            one to three weeks.

            Asymmetrical role. Add fun and replayable things in game. One player drives the firetruck, another one
            controls the water cannon. By assigning different abilities we force players to stay connected to each other
            and
            communicate along the game.
            <br>Unavoidable conflict. It is supposed to be a fast paced game no longer than 2min each round. The
            battleground gets
            smaller as the game goes on, players will have to fight more intensely.
            Reasonable randomness. For competitive games people are expecting each round to be different (and the result
            as
            well).
            It’s not good to be 100% skill or 100% luck, so adding a little randomness will help the game gets fun. The
            randomness
            must be well controlled to not overwhelm players’ performance.
            <br>Visual Instructions. Tell the players what will happen in game and make them understand the situation.

            Clearer instructions. There is almost no tutorial so we have to tell players manually how to play and win
            the
            game.
            <br> Balance. Most players claim that driving is actually harder than spraying water. It is not a bad thing
            to
            have a diverse
            job difficulty inside a team, but we need to clarify it in the first place or players might get frustrated
            for
            underperforming.

            An easy story with ups and downs. It will be a 4min experience including interaction time so do not make the
            story too
            complicated. We go for a classroom romance since everyone probably has some experience on that. And we think
            adding a
            little surprise in story would help with the emotional flow.
            <br>Meaningful interactions. We learn from What Remains of Edith Finch combining interactions with story. We
            leave important
            moments waiting to be accomplished by player interaction so they feel being in the situation rather than
            watching a
            story sequence.

            Delivering the interaction more clearly. Some players have a hard time figuring out how the story and
            interaction is
            connected. And it is hard to have the same feeling as What Remains of Edith Finch as we are short on art and
            sound
            resources. So it might be better if we deliver the interaction in a clearer way with less metaphors.
            <br>More playtesting. More playtesters help more in finding bugs and testing the interactions. If they don’t
            understand, that is
            probably we are making it too complicated.

            Think of the hardware. We are putting players into a very special game environment where they are surrounded
            by three
            large screens so they are like ‘inside’ the game world. This is an excellent chance for us to make a fully
            immersive
            game so we start the exploration concepting a Egytian pyramid where adventurers go and find treasures by
            solving
            puzzles.
            <br>Be aware of experience flow. At the early stage the game merely consists of multiple puzzles with little
            transition
            between each other, which for most players could be tedious. I then suggested that we have pre-scripted
            animations
            between two puzzles so the experience will have its relaxed and intense part. That is also how we implement
            story into
            the actual game. [PICTURE jiaocha]
            <br>Unified theme. At first we have many ideas about puzzles and they all seem to work in some way. But
            after
            several playtests we find that have just one unified theme for all puzzles will make it clearer for players
            and
            easier
            to control the difficulty for designers. We agreed on using ‘light’ as our core element as it is COOL and
            uses
            CAVE
            environment in a smart way. [PICTURE]

            Be aware of experience for the whole process. We have some really nice puzzles and our environment really
            has Egyptian
            feeling, but that doesn’t work very well if the experience is way too long. We have a 9 min playthrough
            which
            exceeds
            the 6 min expectation much. It turns out we still need more playtests as some players may need more time to
            understand
            and play with the mechanics.
